<span id="receipts"></span><h1>Warehouse Receipts<a class="headerlink" href="#warehouse-receipts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Warehouse Receipt documents should be printed, signed by the warehouse manager,
and issued to the customer. Under the law a warehouser is not required to
issue receipts, but courts have ruled that:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>&#8221;... a failure to issue or deliver such receipt constitutes negligence on
the part of the warehouseman for which he may be held liable for any loss
occasioned thereby to the depositor.&#8221;</em> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id1">[1]</a></div></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, every warehouser needs to issue receipts at all times, and to be
certain that these documents satisfy his legal responsibilities.</p>
<div class="section" id="terms-required-by-the-u-c-c">
<h2>Terms Required by the U.C.C.<a class="headerlink" href="#terms-required-by-the-u-c-c" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The warehouser&#8217;s legal responsibilities are stated in the Uniform Commercial
Code (U.C.C.) Section 7-202(2):</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Unless a warehouse receipt embodies within its written or printed terms
each of the following, the warehouse is liable for damages caused by the
omission to a person injured thereby:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>the location of the warehouse where the goods are stored;</li>
<li>the date of issue of the receipt;</li>
<li>the consecutive number of the receipt;</li>
<li>a statement whether the goods received will be delivered to the bearer,
to a specified person, or to a specified person or his order;</li>
<li>the rate of storage and handling charges, except that where goods are
stored under a field warehousing arrangement a statement of that fact is
sufficient on a non-negotiable receipt;</li>
<li>a description of the goods or of the packages containing them;</li>
<li>the signature of the warehouseman, which may be made by his authorized
agent;</li>
<li>if the receipt is issued for goods of which the warehouseman is the
owner, either solely or jointly in common with others, the fact of such
ownership; and</li>
<li>a statement of the amount of advances made and of liabilities incurred
for which the warehouseman claims a lien or security interest
(Section 7-209). If the precise amount of such advances made or of such
liabilities is, at the time of the issue of the receipt, unknown to the
warehouseman or to his agent who issues it, a statement of the fact that
advances have been made or liabilities incurred and the purpose thereof
is sufficient. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id2">[2]</a></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>So a warehouser is not required to issue receipts, and receipts do not have to
contain particular terms, but failure to issue receipts including the preceding
terms makes the warehouser laible in any disputes involving those omissions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="warehouse-receipt-documents">
<h2>Warehouse Receipt Documents<a class="headerlink" href="#warehouse-receipt-documents" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Issuing Warehouse Receipts is a fundamental aspect of warehousing by which the
warehouser protects his own interests and notifies the customer of the shared
obligations for care of goods.</p>
<p>In this context, the WARES program provides automated steps to issue receipt
documents which meet legal requirements as stated previously. The document form
used by WARES may be viewed here: <a class="reference internal" href="receipt.html#warehouse-receipt"><em>Non-Negotiable Warehouse Receipt (blank)</em></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="u-c-c-required-elements">
<h2>U.C.C. Required Elements<a class="headerlink" href="#u-c-c-required-elements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="a-warehouse-buildings">
<h3>a. Warehouse Buildings<a class="headerlink" href="#a-warehouse-buildings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The top line of the receipt states the operating name of the warehouse company,
with the physical location of the warehouse storage building stated below that.</p>
<img alt="_images/receipt-a-b-c.png" src="_images/receipt-a-b-c.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="b-consecutive-receipt-number">
<h3>b. Consecutive Receipt Number<a class="headerlink" href="#b-consecutive-receipt-number" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To guarantee that every receipt is actually issued, the warehouse manager should
maintain a hand register of the consecutive numbers when signing receipts. A
portion of a sample hand register of consecutive receipts is shown following:</p>
<img alt="_images/receipt-register.png" src="_images/receipt-register.png" />
<p>When using a receiving document to update inventory without issuing a receipt,
the consumed numbers should be noted in this register as either balances posted
into history, such as inventory starting balances (UNISSUED), or as transactions
entered in error and then deleted (VOIDED). (Unissued and voided documents are
maintained in the WARES database for reference.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="c-receipt-issue-date">
<h3>c. Receipt Issue Date<a class="headerlink" href="#c-receipt-issue-date" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To the right of the warehouse building is the consecutive number of the receipt,
with the date of receipt below. The receipt date is taken from the date and time
that the receipt is completed and authenticated by warehouse personnel.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="d-delivery-orders">
<h3>d. Delivery Orders<a class="headerlink" href="#d-delivery-orders" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Where standard terms must be expressed, the language is pre-printed on the face
of the warehouse receipt. This includes the agreed delivery terms for the
warehouse, as required in U.C.C. item (d).</p>
<img alt="_images/receipt-d.png" id="receipt-d" src="_images/receipt-d.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="e-storage-and-handling-rates">
<h3>e. Storage and Handling Rates<a class="headerlink" href="#e-storage-and-handling-rates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Typically storage and handling rates do vary from customer to customer, and the
rates may vary from product to product within a customer. Therefore rates are
listed for each received product, as shown in the following figure:</p>
<img alt="_images/receipt-e-f-i.png" id="receipt-e-f-i" src="_images/receipt-e-f-i.png" />
<p>WARES uses code <strong>1R</strong> to represent <em>Receiving Storage</em> and code <strong>1H</strong> for
<em>Receiving Handling</em>. This example shows industry recognized unit of measure
codes <strong>CW</strong> for <em>Hundredweight</em> and <strong>RL</strong> for <em>roll</em> to complete the rate
extension. (The warehouse may also charge minimum fees, or a storage fee may be
prorated, in which case rates do not extend to the amount column.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="f-description-of-goods">
<h3>f. Description of Goods<a class="headerlink" href="#f-description-of-goods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The description of goods includes the textual name, identifiers and marks, and
counts and weights.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="g-the-warehouser-s-signature">
<h3>g. The Warehouser&#8217;s Signature<a class="headerlink" href="#g-the-warehouser-s-signature" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The warehouse manager or his authorized agent should sign every warehouse
receipt, and receipts should be recorded in the receipt register as they are
issued.</p>
<img alt="_images/receipt-g-h.png" id="receipt-g-h" src="_images/receipt-g-h.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="i-statement-of-liabilities">
<h3>i. Statement of Liabilities<a class="headerlink" href="#i-statement-of-liabilities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Rates are known when the warehouse receipt is finalized, and so the extension
of the rates and a total of the liabilities (charges due) is part of the
receipt. The text in section (d) above also clarifies that the warehouse lien
covers this receipt and any charges due from the customer on other accounts.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-receipt-terms">
<h2>Other Receipt Terms<a class="headerlink" href="#other-receipt-terms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Other parts of the law and court decisions based on it extend the warehouser&#8217;s
responsibilities beyond the previously stated requirements. In general, a
warehouser is expected to care for deposited goods using the actions of a
reasonable person who is capable in his job, who is generally knowledgeable
(about warehousing), knows the legal requirements, and is fair-minded. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id3">[3]</a></p>
<p>In return, the warehouser may contract for certain rights. The receipt must
include information relevant to these rights, so that the warehouser can
receive these benefits.</p>
<div class="section" id="a-received-condition">
<h3>a. Received Condition<a class="headerlink" href="#a-received-condition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The warehouser is responsible for the quantity and condition of goods once
received. Overages, shortages, and damage which exist when goods are received
must be noted on the receipt, as shown by titles in the
<a class="reference internal" href="#receipt-e-f-i"><em>Product Itemization</em></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="b-storage-type-zone">
<h3>b. Storage Type Zone<a class="headerlink" href="#b-storage-type-zone" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Warehouse locations should be zoned to match the goods in storage, and these
zones must be specific enough to prevent mistakes. For example, it is not enough
to use zones COOL and FROZEN in refrigeration. If frozen goods include both ice
cream and dog food then ice cream can be in a general freezer. But anyone
operating a freezer should know that dog food requires a separate PETFOOD room
and zone.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="c-customer-instructions">
<h3>c. Customer Instructions<a class="headerlink" href="#c-customer-instructions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A warehouser may know to separate ice cream from dog food, but many products
have storage and handling requirements which are too esoteric to be generally
known. The customer needs to supply these instructions with each shipment, and
the specific cautions should be acknowledged on the receipt, shown in <strong>SPECIAL
INSTRUCTIONS</strong> below:</p>
<img alt="_images/receipt-c1.png" src="_images/receipt-c1.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="d-reference-information">
<h3>d. Reference Information<a class="headerlink" href="#d-reference-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Cross-reference information allows the customer to correlate a warehouse receipt
with his own records, his supplier, and the carrier, as shown above.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="e-warehouser-s-lien">
<h3>e. Warehouser&#8217;s Lien<a class="headerlink" href="#e-warehouser-s-lien" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A warehouse may impose a lien for services, so the warehouse may demand payment
before releasing goods from bailment. The <a class="reference internal" href="#receipt-d"><em>Warehouser&#8217;s Lien</em></a>
is effective only if the rates for calculation and the
<a class="reference internal" href="#receipt-g-h"><em>Amount Due</em></a> are displayed on the receipt.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="f-limitation-of-liability">
<h3>f. Limitation of Liability<a class="headerlink" href="#f-limitation-of-liability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The receipt establishes a limitation of warehouse liability for negligence,
which is taken from the warehouse setup or derived from a declaration of value
on the account setup. This <a class="reference internal" href="#receipt-d"><em>Liability Limitation</em></a> is printed in
red in the example receipt.</p>

<div class="section" id="industry-contract-terms">
<h2>Industry Contract Terms<a class="headerlink" href="#industry-contract-terms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are several trade associations for public warehousing, with principal ones
being the <strong>International Association of Refrigerated Warehouses</strong> (IARW) and
the <strong>International Warehousing and Logistics Association</strong> (IWLA). These groups
have promulgated standard contract terms for members to use. Familiarity with
these terms is expected of corporate logistics personnel, so warehousers who
adopt these standard terms can conduct business without recourse to expensive,
and frequently faulty, legal representation.</p>
<p>Versions of these Standard Terms are posted here for reference:</p>
