SECTION 1.  INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS: WARES version 4.33B     
        
Check your current WARES version before installing this program. The About    
window on the bottom of the eXit (or Access) menu shows the WARES version.    
        
If your version is 4.30 through 4.33A:
        
    Skip the instructions in this section and continue with Section 4.        
        
If your computer uses Windows and has a CD-ROM drive:     
        
    Place this CD in your CD-ROM drive, and note your CD-ROM drive letter.    
    To find the drive letter, open up "My Computer". The CD-ROM drive icon    
    will be named WARES_99, followed by the drive letter in parentheses.      
        
    From the Windows "Start" menu, choose Run....         
    In the Run window, type the command         
      d:\INSTALL c:         
         where  d:  represents your CD-ROM drive letter and         
      c:  is drive letter where the program will be installed.      
    Then press the <Enter> key or click the <OK> button.  
        
    When the file installation completes, click in the "X" box in the upper   
    right corner of the window border to close the window.
        
    Then from the Windows desktop open the icons "My Computer", "Drive C:",   
    and "Atlas" folder. In the Atlas folder, drag the sky-and-lightning       
    Atlas icon to the Windows "Start" button, and drop it there.    
        
    The message, "Windows cannot create a shortcut at this location" may      
    occur. If so, click on the Windows Taskbar start selection with your      
    right mouse button, then choose "Explore" from the popup menu. Finally,   
    drag the sky-and-lightning Atlas icon from the Atlas folder and drop it   
    in the right-hand side of the "Exploring - Start menu" window.  
        
Otherwise get several blank diskettes, then call our support line for help.   
You will receive directions for moving the files onto diskettes.

SECTION 3.  UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS: WARES versions 4.26 through 4.26A  
        
Follow these instructions to update to 4.33B:   
        
    Start ATLAS/WARES from the icon on your start menu (Windows) or from the  
    Task Selector (Citrix MultiUser). When the "Access Data Volumes" popup    
    displays, press <Enter> to select "WARES.DEMO". Logon with your 
    supervisor password.    
        
    Press [F5] for a TCL Command window, and type the command       
        
     RUN BP CONVERT.430     
        
    to convert the data from your WARES version 4.26 to the new program.      
        
When your update is complete, you will be logged off. Delete the old program  
icon from your desktop or start menu.  Use the new Atlas/WARES icon from the  
start menu to run your new WARES version.       
        
Perform the following 4 steps when you start Atlas/WARES the first time       
after updating:   
        
     1) From the menus, choose Tools/Reports/Setup Printers. Verify that the  
        correct printers are displayed, or press [F2] to change the printer   
        setups.   
     2) Choose Tools/Define/Indexes, and enter "Yes <Enter>" to start the     
        "Make Indexes" window. Press [SF2] for the "Get File Name" window.    
        Type the name "EVENTS" and press <Enter> to rebuild EVENTS indexes.   
     3) Choose Access/Volume from the menus, and select your data volume.     
     4) Choose Tools/Actions/Index Flush from the menus.  
        
If you have multiple data volumes, repeat steps 3 and 4 for each volume.      
        
POSSIBLE PROBLEMS 
        
    If the message "The QMAP_SETS table is not available" appears, press      
    <Enter> to continue. Then press <Esc> to leave the resulting CopyRow      
    window. Later the message, "Escape pressed. Cancel Updatetable?" will     
    display. Press <Enter> to accept the default value "No".        
        
    If a message "Cannot write or delete records because Quick/Rightdex..."   
    displays, follow the Section 5 instructions with the following change:    
    the command "AW MAKEINDEX" should be "AW UTIL_WINDOWS MAKEINDEX".

SECTION 4.  UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS: WARES version 4.30 through 4.33A   
        
If you are updating a MultiUser host which does not have a CD-ROM drive, the  
update files must be uploaded to the host from a workstation with a CD-ROM    
drive.  
        
     Insert the WARES_99 CD in the workstation CD-ROM drive.        
     Connect to the host machine using RLink or LanLink.  
     Press Alt_Shift-~ from the task selector to get an OS/2 command prompt.  
     Type the following commands:     
G:<Enter> If G: is not available, type E:<Enter>
MD\UPDATE <Enter> 
CD\UPDATE <Enter> 
DEL. <Enter>      
UPLOAD d:\WARES\433.B\*.* <Enter>     
     where d: represents your workstation CD-ROM drive letter.      
     Type EXIT<Enter> to leave the command prompt when the upload completes.  
        
Starting with version 4.30, each program module in WARES requires executing   
a separate update. Therefore perform the steps in this section four times:    
once each for the modules WARES, TOOLS, EXCHANGE, and CONTACTS. Do not        
attempt to perform the ATLAS update while in the WARES application. 
        
    First, start WARES and login using the supervisor level password.         
        
    From the menus, choose Tools/Actions/Update, and press <Enter> to start.  
        
    Next, you are asked for the drive and path to the update files. Enter     
    the path      
      d:\WARES\433.B\       
         where  d:  represents your CD-ROM drive letter   
        
    or enter the path       
      E:\UPDATE (or G:\UPDATE)        
    if you are updating from uploaded files as described above.     
        
    A popup will display the update sets available at the entered location.   
    Highlight the update to perform and press <Enter>. When asked to install  
    the update, type "Y" and press <Enter>. Your WARES session will 
    terminate when the update finishes.         
        
When all four updates have been performed your WARES copy will be fully       
updated. If you wish, you may open the ATLAS application (from the menu,      
select Access/Open). Then install the ATLAS update in that program using the  
instructions above. Remember to switch back to WARES after finishing.         
        
-----

POSSIBLE PROBLEMS, SECTION 4 (Cont'd.)
        
The program will break to the debugger "!" prompt during the WARES update     
when updating from 4.31 or 4.32 to 4.33B. Close the task, start a new         
session, and run the TOOLS module update. If a message requesting a file      
name for source code appears, enter the name "UTIL_BP". Once the TOOLS        
update is finished, run all four updates: WARES, TOOLS, EXCHANGE and
CONTACTS, to complete the update.     
  
SECTION 5.  QUICKDEX ERROR INSTRUCTIONS

       !!! READ THIS FIRST !!!        
        
The following issues may effect your conversion to WARES version 4.50D:       
        
FREE DAYS. Free days has moved from the Profile setup to the Account setup.   
Where an account has multiple profiles, some with free days and some
without, the products and lots must be split into separate accounts BEFORE    
conversion. Call for assistance if this applies to any of your accounts.      
        
UOM AND COUNTRY CODES. This release replaces the UOM and COUNTRY code tables  
with extended standard code lists. If you have customized UOM codes, the      
custom values can be converted to standard codes according to the   
instructions in help note 90123. COUNTRY codes in addresses are corrected     
using the instructions in help note 90124.      
        
At Tools/Define/Table Codes, record GL_CODE replaces GL.CODE. Print these     
records and examine the chart of accounts ledger codes in COL3. Update the    
new GL_CODE table if any GL codes are missing or account numbers are wrong.   
        
BILLING REPORTS. The CHARGE.LOG used to show all billed transactions; now it  
lists only transactions with charges.

reports. Reports for CHARGES, INVOICES, PAYMENTS, PROFILES or RATES will      
have to be redesigned or discarded after this update. PRODUCTS reports may    
require redesign. New reports must be created wherever a customer requires    
special auditing for billing.         
        
CUSTOMIZED REPORTS. Selection commands XQ, BATCH.LOG, and PRINT.SUBS have     
been reprogrammed and now require different command parameters. If custom     
reports (other than billing reports, as mentioned above) do not work after    
this update, refer to help note 90153 for instructions.   
        
WINDOW MENU KEYS. The [F10] window menu has been enhanced to include every    
key commonly required in data entry or review. Every window uses the same     
menu, except for softkeys and relations. The following keys changed:

UPDATES        4.50D
================================================================================

        
SECTION 4.  CHANGES REQUIRING CORRECTION        
        
1) At Tools/Define/Table Codes, record UOM is renamed UOM.OLD and replaced.   
   Some special UOM codes may require reentry in the UOM table. Updating UOM  
   codes on product records can be performed as a batch process, as 
   described in Help Note 90123.      
        
2) At Tools/Define/Table Codes, record GL_CODE replaces GL.CODE. The old      
   record is kept for reference. Column 3, the Account numbers, may need to   
   be changed in the updated GL_CODE record.    
        
3) At eXchange\Export\Exports, the export template is replaced. If you have   
   been exporting invoices to an accounting program, add the "HISTORY"        
   command on the final line of the template, and check that the file path    
   for export is on the correct drive letter.   
        
4) At Billing/Tariff Setup, new UOM codes on handling and storage tariffs     
   may be required. The conversion simply guesses at the codes. Tariff        
   descriptions should be updated where accounts have multiple tariffs.       
        
5) Selection commands on customized reports may require updating, as
   described in help note 90153.      
        
  
        
To print the program changes notes, select APP_NOTE.RESOLUTIONS from menu

UPDATES        4.50E
================================================================================

        
SECTION 4.  CHANGES REQUIRING CORRECTION        
        
1) At Tools/Define/Table Codes, record UOM is renamed UOM.OLD and replaced.   
   Some special UOM codes may require reentry in the UOM table. Updating UOM  
   codes on product records can be performed as a batch process, as 
   described in Help Note 90123.      
        
2) At Tools/Define/Table Codes, record GL_CODE replaces GL.CODE. The old      
   record is kept for reference. Column 3, the Account numbers, may need to   
   be changed in the updated GL_CODE record.    
        
3) At eXchange\Export\Exports, the export template is replaced. If you have   
   been exporting invoices to an accounting program, add the "HISTORY"        
   command on the final line of the template, and check that the file path    
   for export is on the correct drive letter.   
        
4) At Billing/Tariff Setup, new UOM codes on handling and storage tariffs     
   may be required. The conversion simply guesses at the codes. Tariff        
   descriptions should be updated where accounts have multiple tariffs.       
        
5) Selection commands on customized reports may require updating, as
   described in help note 90153.      
        
  
        
To print the program changes notes, select APP_NOTE.RESOLUTIONS from menu     
Access/=Notes. The date range for this release is 03/01/01 through 04/15/03.  
The employee code is "PN" for Programmer Notes. 
        
Choose APP_NOTE.HELP.TOC from menu selection Access/=Notes to print a list    
of help notes.    
        
To print a specific help note, go to Contacts/Notes. Then enter the number    
of the desired note, and press [SF9] to print out the help document. To       
display notes related to a program window, press [F10],H,N in the window.

   batches. Invoice batches are user-defined to include   
   any or all accounts.     
        
  Invoice Charges      This program accumulates transaction charges into      
   services invoices. A batch of services invoices may

  Audit Charges        Details of the service charges accumulated into        
   invoices are reported on charges audit reports.        
        
  Audit Recurring      These reports itemize inventory balances, recurring    
   storage rates, and extensions of recurring charges.    
        
  Stock Activity       The stock movement or activity during a recurring      
   period is documented with these audit reports.         
        
  
        
INVOICING OVERVIEW.         
        
One of the most complex aspects of warehousing is the preparation of
invoices for warehouse services. WARES automates this task while providing    
fully secure mechanisms for authenticating and documenting the invoices. The  
steps in calculating charges and invoicing begin with entering inventory

ENTERING CHARGES. 
        
All service charges are contained on charge records. Each transaction record  
may have an associated charge record which contains the optional and
mandatory charges for the transaction. Additional charge records may be       
entered for optional charges which are not associated with an inventory       
transaction. Calculated and repeated tariffs may generate additional charge   
records; for example, for recurring storage.    
        
Windows on the Entry menu are used to enter or edit the transactions which    
record warehouse activities. These transactions are the Receipts Inbound,     
the Shipments Outbound and Adjustments to Inventory. Accessorial charges may  
be entered for any receipt, shipment, or adjustment by pressing Shift-F3      
[SF3] during transaction entry. When accessorial charges are not associated   
with a specific inventory movement, the charges may be entered directly       
using the Transaction Charges window on the Billing menu. 
        
CALCULATING MANDATORY CHARGES.        
        
Mandatory charges for transactions should be calculated after all optional    
accessorial charges are entered, as optional charges may not be added once    
mandatory charges are calculated.     
        
The Billing/Batch Billing/Calculate Charges menu selection provides an        
automated routine for applying mandatory charges to entries. Charges are      
also calculated for a transaction during entry by changing the status of a    
record to 4 (Billed). Transactions which have been calculated previously,     
that is, which are status 4, will be skipped when encountered in future       
charges calculations.

MENUS  BILLING.BATCH
================================================================================

        
The Billing menu provides routines for calculating all charges other than     
optional charges. Calculating charges does not invoice transactions.
Calculate Charges, the first selection on the Batch Billing menu, is the      
first step in the billing and invoicing process. This step calculates         
mandatory charges for selected transaction files for a range of days and for  
a selected list of accounts. For most businesses, Calculate Charges should    
be run at the end of each day once entries are checked.   
        
OTHER CHARGES.    
        
Additional charge calculations may be performed periodically. Warehouses      
usually calculate recurring storage charges at the end of each month. A date  
range for the calculation is provided, so these charges may be calculated on  
some other schedule if required.      
        
CHECKING CHARGES. 
        
Before invoicing, the charges to be invoiced may be reviewed and audited by   
printing the Charge Log report from the Billing/-Billing Logs menu choice.    
Invoicing must not be performed until entries are checked and charges are     
complete and checked. Since entries are usually checked at the end of a day,  
and charges are calculated after that, the earliest opportunity to calculate  
invoices is at the end of a day.      
        
INVOICING CHARGES.
        
While a direct invoice may be hand entered, accumulating charges for
activity into invoices is a more efficient and reliable process. Invoicing    
may be performed for a range of days, for a selected list of accounts, and    
for specific charge transaction types. Setup information on the account       
records defines the permissible invoicing intervals for each account: by      
transaction, daily, weekly, semimonthly, monthly, or on demand.     
        
PRINTING INVOICES AND AUDITS.         
        
After invoice calculations are completed, the final invoices and supporting   
reports are printed using the report selections on the bottom half of the     
Batch Billing Menu. Each auditing report group contains selections to print   
summary and detail reports in a variety of layouts.       
        
Two reports are required to audit each recurring invoice. First, a stock      
activity report shows the inventory movement during the period invoiced.      
Second, a recurring charges audit report shows the balances being invoiced    
and the rates and charge extensions which are added to produce the invoice.   
        
At least one report is required for a services invoice. When the invoice is   
limited to receipts only, the Warehouse Receipts are a complete audit of the  
invoice. And if only one receipt is on an invoice, the second copy of the

have multiple lot detail records with multiple locations for each lot. In     
this case, the program will display a list of lot control numbers and a list  
of receiving transaction numbers within any available lot detail. After the   
product to be changed is identified, the control number, product identifier,  
and old location are displayed for verification. Enter a new location code    
in the new location field to complete the location entry. 
        
Locations are validated against the location table. The location table can be 
modified by selecting Location Codes from the Supervisor Menu.      
        
This option is used for transferring all the goods of a lot which are stored  
in a location to another location. To split the goods in a location and move  
part to a different location (for example, to separate damaged goods or       
expired product from main storage), use Inventory Adjustment Entry. For more  
information, see related Topics.

ENTRY         ORDERS
================================================================================

Each order is defined by a record on this window. Order records are the       
transactions by which advance account orders are received. Shipments are      
built from these transactions.        
        
Orders consist of two parts. A header identifies the account, the shipper,    
the date, instructions, and so forth. Detail lines list stock number,         
product number, description, and quantities.    
        
Each detail line contains the order quantity, UOM, pieces quantity, and back  
order or cancel information. Default quantities are automatically determined  
from the factors entered on the product screen. 
        
Press [Shift] F4 within an existing order to pull up the Orders Auxiliary     
window. Each entry line of the order will be displayed in this window as      
well. The BckOrd and Cancel columns of this window are filled in during the   
review orders process. The Ship column is completed during the build
shipments process. BckOrd and Cancel column information may be edited, but    
the Ship column information is changed only through building shipments.       
        
When an order is entered it will be on status 2 (posted). The status of the   
order will not change to 3 (verified) until the order has been reviewed and   
all items on that order are selected for shipping or are canceled.  
        
If one line item on the order is backordered and the rest selected for        
shipping, then the amounts selected for shipping will appear in the ship      
column of the order but the status will remain at 2 until the backordered     
amount is selected for shipping or canceled.    
        
EDI:    
        
Orders for which EDI advice records will be built have more stringent         
requirements than normal orders. The comments below should be considered.     
        
  -Ship To addresses should be entered as an Address record. Entering the     
   address as free form text in the Ship To block does not guarantee
   proper EDI interpretation of this information.         
        
  -Typically, no control numbers should be entered on orders of any kind.     
   However, if a control number is entered, the user should ensure that       
   lot is valid before building shipments. No control number validation       
   is done in the Order window.       
        
  -When viewing orders generated by EDI transactions, the user can see the    
   source EDI document in the RECEIVES window using the [Alt-F9] softkey.

ENTRY   ORDER.REVIEW
================================================================================

Orders Review checks pending orders against inventory for availability.       
The review process is interactive, so that the user can decide how to         
allocate product between orders when the available quantity is insufficient   
to fill all the reviewed orders. Order lines which cannot be filled will be   
either backordered or canceled.       
        
Back Order or Cancel quantities are posted to the selected order lines.       
Backordered or canceled lines will not be included when shipments are built.  
Backorders can be cleared and reassigned by rerunning the orders review.      
Cancellations can be reversed only through clearing the canceled quantities   
on the Pending Orders entry window.   
        
Orders should be reviewed daily for each account to determine whether or      
not pending orders can be shipped. Select reserve, cancel, or backorder in    
the "Backorder/Cancel Unfilled Orders?" field according to how that account   
wants the order to be shipped in the event that the entire order can not be   
filled on the requested ship date.    
        
      1. Reserve: If the account wants the order shipped complete, select     
         reserve. If reserve is entered and at least one line item can not    
         be shipped then none of the items on the order will be selected for  
         shipping. The status of the order will be changed from 2 to 1 and    
         the amount not available will appear in the backorder column of the  
         order. When a receipt comes in for the item that was previously      
         unavailable, query orders by date, status = 1, and for that
         specific account. Change each order in the query to status 2 and     
         then review orders for this account to select items for shipping     
         (Review Orders selects only orders with status 2.)         
        
      2. Cancel: If the account wants to cancel all line items that can not   
         be shipped on the ship date, enter cancel in this field. All         
         available items will be selected for shipping and all unavailable    
         items will be canceled. Canceled items must be reordered.  
        
      3. Backorder: If the account wants to backorder all line items that     
         can not be shipped on the ship date, enter backorder in this field.  
         All available items will be selected for shipping and all  
         unavailable will be backordered. The order will remain on status 2.  
         When a receipt comes in for the backordered item, review orders for  
         this account to clear the backorder. Then go to Build Shipments to   
         ship the backorder.
        
If all items are available the order will be prepared for shipping. The       
status of the order will change from 2 to 3 and the amounts selected for      
shipping will appear in the ship column of the order.     
        
Enter "Yes" in the "Clear Existing Backorders at Start?" field to take the    
backorder amount out of the backorder column of the order. This must be done  
when a receipt comes in for the product on backorder so that the

WINDOW PURPOSE.   
        
The Receipts Inbound window is used to enter or review Warehouse Receipts in  
the current period, or to view the perpetual history file of all billed       
receipts. Charges associated with the receiving transaction such as special   
handling and overtime must be entered from the warehouse receipt window.      
(Press Shift- function key 3 [SF3] to display the charges entry sub-window.)  
        
TRANSACTION DESIGN.         
        
Warehouse receipts consist of two parts. A header identifies the account,     
the shipper, the date, instructions, and so forth. Detail lines list
transactions by product number, lot control number, descriptions, and         
quantities. Detail lines are posted to lots by product and control number. A  
default control number based on the transaction entry date will be generated  
automatically if none is entered.     
        
LOT FACTORS.      
        
Each detail line contains the unit quantity being received and the factors    
to convert to storage and weight units. The conversion factors default to     
the entries for the product. Each lot may override these default factors by   
entering new factors on the initial receipt of the lot. When entered
factors conflict with existing factors on a lot, the lot corrections window   
will appear to resolve the conflict.  
        
Frequently goods are received with odd pallet quantities. For example, 100    
cases stacked 36 to a pallet requires that one pallet contain only 28 cases.  
If this is entered under one control number, the billing routines will        
automatically detect the odd pallet and charge a partial pallet fee, if       
defined. Enter two detail lines if this partial pallet fee is not desired.    
        
SERIAL NUMBERS.   
        
Products may be defined to require serial numbers for the pieces units, the   
storage units, or other measured quantities. When serialized products are     
received, the serial numbers for each lot control number are entered in a     
sub-window at the end of each transaction line. (That is, when return is      
pressed at the stack factor field.) Serialized lots allow for entering        
multiple partial pallets within a single lot. Serial numbers must be unique   
within each lot control number.       
        
OVER/SHORT/DAMAGED/REFUSED. 
        
Product received may be marked as Over, Short, Damaged, or Refused. Press     
[SF4] to access the Over/Short/Damaged/Refused window during detail line      
entry. Also use the OSDR window to display hash totals for the entered        
columns on the receipt. The OSDR window displays the conversion quantities    
resulting from the entered factors.

THE WAREHOUSE RECEIPT DOCUMENT.       
        
The warehouse receipt is the most common form of warehouse contract. Failure  
to issue warehouse receipts is negligence on the part of the warehouser. The  
Uniform Commercial Code, Section 7-202(2) states that the warehouse is        
liable for damages caused by omitting any of the following information from   
the warehouse receipt:      
        
   a) the warehouse building address where the goods are stored;    
   b) the date of issue of the receipt;         
   c) the consecutive number of the receipt;    
   d) a statement of delivery requirements (bearer, or depositor's order);    
   e) rate of storage and handling charges, or a field warehouse disclaimer;  
   f) a description of the goods or of the packages containing them;
   g) the signature of the warehouser or his authorized agent;      
   h) a statement if the warehouser has ownership interest in the goods;      
   i) the amount of charges incurred for which the warehouser claims a lien.  
        
Setting up WARES correctly guarantees that warehouse receipts can be issued   
according to these legal and contractual requirements.    
        
WAREHOUSE BUILDINGS.        
        
Warehouse buildings require separate address records with type code "B".      
Warehouse companies usually number their buildings starting with "1", or      
letter the buildings starting with "A". Single characters are recommended     
for building identifiers since this identifier is incorporated into the       
warehouse location codes.   
        
RECEIPT NUMBERS.  
        
WARES guarantees unique consecutive numbering for all transactions. By WARES  
convention receipts are numbered starting with "3". The warehouser must       
maintain a hand register of the consecutive numbers when signing receipts.    
Missing numbers should be noted in the register as either balances posted     
into history without issuing a receipt (UNUSED), or transactions entered in   
error and then deleted (VOIDED). (Blank register pages may be printed from    
the Tools/-Reports menu selection, FORMS document RECEIPT in APP_DOCUMENTS.)  
        
STORAGE AND HANDLING CHARGES.         
        
Since storage and handling charges are referred to within the law, these      
charge codes must not be used for any services other than those defined in    
the contract (on the back of the preprinted receipt form). Storage and        
handling charges are extended per unit of good from the product tariff,       
and accessorial charges with these codes are suppressed from printing.        
The warehouse receipt itemizes any other accessorial charges for the
transaction and prints the totals for storage, handling, and other charges.

ENTRY       RECEIPTS
================================================================================

        
ACCESSORIAL RATES.
        
Default accessorial charges should be established for every service which     
the warehouse expects to offer its accounts. When an account requests a       
service which is not specifically provided for in his contract, the 
warehouse receipt contract states that the warehouser will perform the        
service at the rates then in effect.  
        
Warehouse standard rates are defined on tariffs which do not have an account  
entry. By convention, these rates use the tariff identifier "DEFAULT".        
Account contracted accessorial tariff rates are defined from the account,     
product, or charges windows by pressing [AF9].  
        
LIMITATION OF DAMAGES.      
        
Section 7-204 of the Uniform Commercial Code sets forth the warehouser's      
standard of care, and permits the warehouser to set a limit on the amount of  
damages for which he will be responsible. This limit must be expressed per    
article, per item, or per weight; and the account must be allowed to
declare a higher limit (and pay a correspondingly higher charge).   
        
The limitation of damages is not a legally required element of the receipt,   
but it must be stated on the receipt for the warehouser to claim this         
protection. This limitation is expressed in large print on the warehouse      
receipt because of its importance to the warehouse. The limitation from the   
Warehouse Company Information will print on the warehouse receipt unless a    
different declared value limit is entered on the account or on specific       
product information records.
        
RECEIPT MESSAGES. 
        
Warehouse receipts must contain storage and handling rates and the itemized   
charges assessed, as noted above. Therefore charges must be applied to a      
receiving transaction before the receipt can be printed. Receipts may be      
issued either prior to or following the calculation of an invoice for the     
receipt charges. The preprinted receipt form is identical in either case.     
        
Receipt documents which are printed prior to invoicing will not have an       
invoice number, an invoice date, or a charges total in the "pay this amount"  
blank. The receipt message will be printed on the bottom of the receipt to    
tell the recipient that the receipt is not an invoice. Also, the warehouser   
should retain copy 2 (Original Invoice) of the warehouse receipt to be sent   
with the invoice which will follow. The recommended receipt message is:       
        
NOT AN INVOICE. DO NOT PAY FROM THIS DOCUMENT.  
        
Copy 2 of Receipt documents which are printed after invoicing should be       
attached to the cover invoice for services when it is sent to the account.    

================================================================================

ENTRY       RECEIPTS
================================================================================

These receipts will include the referenced invoice number, the invoice date,  
and the charges total of the receipt. This is NOT the total of the invoice    
when more than one receipt is included in the invoice. Therefore the
account must reference the cover invoice when paying a group of receipts      
invoiced together. The recommended invoiced receipt message is:     
        
DUE UPON RECEIPT. REFER TO INVOICE WITH PAYMENT.
        
The warehouser should claim a lien for charges. The receipt must be invoiced  
due upon receipt to perfect this lien. Otherwise the warehouser's duty to     
deliver would prevent him from collecting until the goods were gone.
        
RECEIVING TALLY.  
        
The carrier's bill of lading and/or packing slip should be used for entering  
the initial warehouse receipt record. Place the receipt on hold to avoid      
posting it at this time. Then a blind tally sheet should be used by the dock  
worker to unload, segregate, count, and locate the goods. After this tally    
is returned to the office, the tally should be compared with the initial      
receipt record and any corrections for Over/Short/Damaged/Refused (OSDR)      
should be made. These corrections must be noted when signing for the goods,   
and will be reported on the warehouse receipt.  
        
CONSIGNEES.       
        
To avoid responsibility for freight charges under standard bill of lading     
terms, the warehouser must not accept goods as consignee. If the carrier's    
bill of lading lists the warehouser as consignee, then the warehouser should  
advise the carrier in writing that it is an agent for the account prior to    
signing for the goods. Attach a notice to carrier's bill of lading to show    
the correct account, care of the warehouse; or write a correction to the      
consignee information on the bill of lading before signing.

ENTRY      SHIPMENTS
================================================================================

Each shipment order is defined by a record on this window. Shipment order     
records are the transactions by which inventory lots are withdrawn from       
products. Charges associated with the shipping transaction such as special    
handling and overtime may also be entered on the shipment order.    
        
Shipment orders consist of two parts. A header identifies the account, the    
shipper, the date, instructions, and so forth. Detail lines list    
transactions by product number, lot control number, description, and
quantities.       
        
Each inventory detail line contains the pieces quantity, storage quantity,    
and weight quantity being shipped. Default storage and weight quantities are  
automatically determined from the factors entered on the warehouse receipt.   
Shipment transactions which result in a broken pallet are detected and the    
broken pallet quantity is set automatically. If a product is serialized, the  
serial number popup will appear so that the serial numbers to be shipped can  
be picked.        
        
Detail lines are posted to products by control number. Control numbers must   
be unique on each product.

ENTRY    ADJUSTMENTS
================================================================================

Each inventory adjustment is defined by a record on this window. Adjustments  
are the transactions by which inventory quantities are changed to account     
for losses or overages, and to transfer goods between lots. The adjustment    
window allows both increments and decrements to lot quantities. New 
inventory lot control numbers may also be created through adjustment
transactions.     
        
Adjustment records consist of two parts. A header identifies the account,     
the date, instructions, and so forth. Detail lines list transactions by       
product number, lot receipt/control numbers, descriptions, and quantities.    
        
Each inventory detail line contains the piece unit quantity being changed,    
the storage quantity, and the weight quantity. Default storage and weight     
quantities are calculated from the storage and weight factors of the detail   
lot being adjusted. When a new lot is created, the storage and weight         
defaults are calculated from factors on the product.      
        
Inventory products may require serial numbers for the piece units, the        
storage units, or other measures. When adjustments are made to serialized     
products, the affected serial numbers are entered at the end of each
transaction line. (That is, when <enter> is pressed at the broken pallet      
field.) See related Topics for information on serial number entry.  
        
Control numbers must be unique on each inventory product. A default control   
number will be generated automatically if none is entered. Serial numbers     
must be unique within each control number lot.  
        
Adjustments may also be used to mark product as damaged and also to change    
Over, Short, or Refused quantities associated with a lot. Press [SF4] to      
access the Over/Short/Damaged/Refused window. See related Topics for more     
information.      
        
  
        
OWNERSHIP TRANSFERS.        
        
Ownership transfers are a constant occurrence in commodity warehousing, and   
are sometimes required with general merchandise as well. WARES can easily     
record the transfer between warehouse accounts of goods stored in the         
warehouse.        
        
CONFIGURING PRODUCTS.       
        
Before ownership transfers can be performed, the PRODUCTS and TARIFFS files   
must be properly configured. Both accounts involved in the transfer must      
have a product record for the goods transferred. Under certain      
circumstances, explained below, a second profile record must be created for   
each account's product.

ENTRY    ADJUSTMENTS
================================================================================

Except for four fields, the product records should be identical:    
        
    Product: each record must have a unique identifier.   
    account: each record is associated with a different account.    
    Tariff: tariffs generally belong to one account only, so each product     
    record is associated with a different profile. Some warehouses  
    (especially those which serve commodity brokers) have identical fee       
    structures for many or even all of their accounts. In such a case, a      
    single tariff may be used for groups of accounts.     
    Stock Number: the accounts' own identifiers for the product will be       
    different.    
        
The product records can be entered in the following manner:         
        
1.  Enter and save the first product record.    
2.  Redisplay the record by pressing Alt-O and <enter>.   
3.  Press [SF7], Change Preserved Data and Tab Settings. Select Preserve      
    Data Entry Fields, and a multi-selection popup of fields on the 
    product window appears. Highlight and select all fields except for        
    the four listed above. Press [F9] to return to the product window.        
4.  Enter a new identifier for the second product record. Preserved field     
    entries from the first record will automatically appear. Enter the new    
    values for Account, Stock Number, and Tariff, and save the record.        
        
For more detailed information on creating product records, see related        
Topics, and the detail help attached to each field in the product window      
(press [F1] to see detail help).      
        
TRANSFER ADJUSTMENT.        
        
There are two methods used to enter the ownership transfer in WARES,
depending on whether a new warehouse receipt is to be issued to the new       
owner of the goods.         
        
If a new warehouse receipt is not issued, the transfer is accomplished with   
an Inventory Adjustment with two detail lines. The account field in the       
adjustment header will contain the identifier of the account receiving the    
goods. On the first detail line, enter the product identifier for the goods'  
current owner. The system will warn you that the product does not belong to   
the account listed. Complete the detail line by adjusting the product DOWN    
to 0. On the second detail line enter the receiver's product ID and create a  
new lot with an equal quantity.       
        
If a new warehouse receipt is issued, the transfer is accomplished with an    
adjustment and a receipt. Create an adjustment for the goods' current owner,  
adjusting the affected lot quantity down to 0. Then create a receipt for the  
new owner creating a new lot of equal quantity.

ENTRY    ADJUSTMENTS
================================================================================

        
If a warehouse receipt is used in a transfer then handling and storage        
charges will be calculated on the document. To avoid these charges, backdate  
the receipt to a closed period to put it in history. Otherwise, the charges   
must be removed or offset.  
        
If the account for the transferred goods grants free days, then enter the     
transfer using a receipt backdated to the original receiving date to credit   
the free days to the new owner and allow for collecting receiving and         
recurring charges. If the free days are expired, perform the transfer with    
an adjustment so that no free days are used. (Receipts have free days, but    
adjustments do not.) Do not use an adjustment to transfer ownership of goods  
during the free period, as this will lose the receiving storage charges.

ENTRY        DETAILS
================================================================================

The Detail Inventory Lot Review window displays the complete receipt and      
shipment history of each lot entered in the warehouse inventory. Two files may
be viewed from this window: the file of current lots in the warehouse, and the
perpetual history of lots which have been fully shipped and closed. To switch 
between files viewed in the window, first press function key 10 [F10] to      
display the window menu. Select File from the menu, then select the desired   
menu from the resulting popup. The file currently being viewed in a window    
will be highlighted in the popup.     
        
Products may be defined to require serial numbers for the piece units,        
storage units, or other measures. The serial numbers for serialized products  
may be reviewed on this window by holding down the shift key while pressing   
function key 8 [SF8].       
        
When the cursor is in any field in the top of the window, The serial number   
popup will display the serial numbers available on the inventory lot. When    
the cursor is in the transaction lines, the popup will display serial         
numbers assigned to the specific transaction line which contains the cursor.  
        
The number of pieces marked as Damaged in each transaction detail line may    
be reviewed in an auxiliary window by pressing [SF4]. The Detail Inventory    
Lot Review window can be accessed directly from the inventory entry windows   
(Products, Receipts, Shipments, and Adjustments) by pressing [AF6]. 
        
No information on this window can be edited by the user during normal entry.  
The supervisor login permits entries in the top half of the screen to be      
edited, provided recurring calculations have not been run to close the lot.

ENTRY    CORRECTIONS
================================================================================

The Lot Control Corrections window is displayed when the storage or weight    
factors being entered on a receipt conflict with factor information on prior  
lot entries. The correction may be of two types: either the factors for the   
lot being entered may be changed to agree with prior lot entries, or the      
control number for the lot may be changed to create a new lot.      
        
The lot corrections window allows the following actions:  
        
  *  The control number may be changed to match any prior lot. Changing the   
     control number to that of a prior lot will force the storage and weight  
     factors to change to the entries of the prior lot.   
        
  *  A new control number may be entered. This requires entering new storage  
     and weight factors for the new lot. The factors will default to factor   
     values on the receipt, or to values from the product record.   
        
  *  The factors entered for the current lot may be changed, provided this    
     receipt line is the only receiving entry posted on the lot.    
        
WARES checks each receiving entry against other entries on the same receipt   
and against any existing lot details. (This presumes that no more than one    
receipt for any particular product and control number will be entered at the  
same time.) If the product and control number for this entry matches any      
previous entry, the storage and weight factors are checked. When a factor     
does not match prior factor entries, the lot control corrections window is    
called to make the correction.        
        
For more information on receipt entry, see related Topics.

ENTRY        SERIALS
================================================================================

Use the serial number entry window to enter or revise serial number lists     
for lots in the warehouse. Serial number lists can be revised up until        
withdrawals are taken from the lot. After shipments are entered against a     
lot, the serial number entry window will be replaced by a popup review list   
of serial numbers. Transactions which have been written to history cannot be  
modified.         
        
Serial number entry windows may be called from the Enter Warehouse Receipts   
and Inventory Adjustment Entry windows. The Shipment Order Entry and Detail   
Inventory Lot Review windows display the serial number review and selection   
popup lists. The type of serialization specified for a product determines     
which serial number entry window will be used. Serial number lists can        
include piece counts, weights, other measures, locations, and descriptions.   
When no serialization is specified for a product, the default serial number   
entry window is displayed. Pressing the serialization key will call the       
default serial window from any other serialization window. This window        
contains all of the information listed previously.        
        
Serial number lists are maintained as entered or selected on the source       
transaction records, and can be reviewed from the history file. The detail    
lot record also contains a list of serial numbers remaining in inventory on   
the lot. Therefore serial numbers provide a perpetual audit trail of exactly  
what is received at, on hand, and shipped from the warehouse.

ENTRY OSDR
================================================================================

The Over/Short/Damaged/Refused window is accessed by pressing [SF4] in the    
Shipment Order Entry, Enter Warehouse Receipts, and Inventory Adjustment      
Entry windows. Over, short, damaged, and refused quantities for the 
inventory transaction are entered on this window. The storage, weight, and    
broken unit quantities calculated from warehouse receipt factors may also be  
reviewed on this window.    
        
When an over quantity is entered, the additional amount adds to the existing  
pieces quantity. Storage, weight, and broken pallet entries are recalculated  
to include the increased number of pieces. The algebraic sign of short and    
refused quantities reverses automatically. The pieces, storage, weight, and   
broken pallet quantities are updated to remove the short quantity. Damaged    
entries do not affect the other quantities of the transaction. However,       
damage is posted to the detail lot and is tracked when goods are withdrawn.   
When entering a shipment order for a lot containing damaged goods, WARES      
will display the number of damaged pieces that are contained in the lot, and  
ask how many damaged pieces, if any, to include in the shipment.    
        
Over, short, damaged and refused quantities can also be accessed in the Lot   
Control Adjustment window by pressing [SF4]. If some product is damaged       
during handling in the warehouse, for example, you will need to document      
this with an adjustment.    
        
Hint: some warehouses keep damaged products in a separate location while      
retaining the same lot control number.  If you follow this practice, you      
will need to create two detail lines on the adjustment to mark product as     
damaged.  On the first detail line, enter the location where undamaged        
product is kept and adjust the quantity DOWN by the damaged amount.  On the   
second detail line, enter the location for damaged product and adjust the     
quantity UP by the same amount.  Then access the Over/Short/Damaged/Refused   
window and place the same quantity in the damaged column of the second        
detail line ONLY. 
        
Damaged product within a lot may be reviewed on a transaction-by-transaction  
basis from the Detail Inventory Lot Review window by pressing [SF4]. For      
more information on transaction entry, see related Topics.

WAREHOUSE PURPOSE.
        
Each data volume requires a Warehouse Company Information control record.     
This record, which displays automatically when the window opens, contains     
the default warehouse limitation of damages, links to company addresses, and  
message statements for warehouse receipts and other invoices.       
        
WAREHOUSE LIMITATION FOR DAMAGES.     
        
Section 7-204 of the Uniform Commercial Code sets forth the warehouser's      
standard of care, and allows for a limit on the amount of damages for which   
he will be liable. This limitation should be expressed per article, per       
item, or per weight. The limitation from the Warehouse Company Information    
will print on the warehouse receipts unless a different limit is entered on   
on an account setup record or on a product record.        
        
WAREHOUSE ADDRESSES.        
        
The Warehouse Company Information window contains links to address records    
for the warehouse business offices. The operating locations of the company    
are maintained in separate building address records which may be entirely     
different from the business addresses. Warehouse business address records     
must have a type code of "C" for company; building addresses have a type      
code of "B" for building. Shared address records must have both type codes.   
        
To enter an address record, press function key 10, then select Edit from the  
window menu ([F10],L or else [Alt-F10]). The address window will display.     
Choose an identifier for the record and then enter the rest of the address.   
Press function key [F9] to save the completed address, then press <Esc> to    
return to the Warehouse Company Information window. Then enter the address    
record identifier on the Warehouse record.      
        
RECEIPT MESSAGES. 
        
Receipts which are issued prior to invoicing should have a printed message    
to tell the recipient that the receipt is not an invoice. Invoiced receipts   
should state that the charges are due upon receipt.       
        
DATABASE VOLUME CONTROL.    
        
In addition to the Warehouse Company Information window, the Volume Control   
Setup window contains control information for your data volume. This window   
appeared when the current data volume was attached for the first time. If     
you need to return to the Volume Control window later, press [F10],K from     
the Warehouse Company Setup window. The Volume Control Setup Window is one    
of the options available in the Warehouse window.

SETUP      LOCATIONS
================================================================================

The location entry window is used to setup codes for the locations within a   
building. Location codes may be defined for building zones, rooms, aisles,    
aisles and rows, racks, racks and slots, or virtually any other location      
arrangement. The following guidelines apply to location codes:      
        
  *  The code must consist of letters only,     
  *  Each code must be unique within a building,
  *  Each code may have no, one, or two numeric ranges associated with it.    
  *  Numeric ranges may be separated by a letter delimiter or a dash.         
        
In the first field enter the number of the building for which you are         
defining locations, then enter the starting letters for a code in the next    
field. As you fill out each code record with numeric ranges and delimiters,   
the description field will automatically show you how the codes will appear   
on WARES documents. If you want only one numeric range on a code, but would   
like the code letter and range number to be separated by a dash (easier to    
read), leave the First Range fields blank and enter data in the Second        
Range. After entering each location code, press [F9] to save it. Remember,    
codes must be created separately for each warehouse building.       
        
TIP: You should define a "dummy" code for each building which does not        
reference an actual location. This is because when entering an adjustment     
you may not know the actual location of the lot you wish to adjust. In such   
a case you can enter your "dummy" location code, after which WARES will       
automatically insert the correct location. In the demonstration data volume,  
the dummy code is WH. To enter a code without numeric ranges, press <Enter>   
through all the fields. This will insert a hyphen in the delimiter and allow  
the code to be saved.

Entries in the Setup Accounts window maintain address information and         
define the invoicing terms and cycle for the account. Also the account        
window may be used to review financial information and inventory balances.    
The account's sales history by month, products on-hand balances, and other    
information may be accessed through softkeys. For a listing of related        
windows press [Ctrl-F6] or else [F10] and select Relations. For a list of     
available softkeys press [F6] or else press [F10] and select Keys.  
        
ACCOUNT DEFINITION
        
Each master record in this window defines a warehouse account. Accounts must  
be defined here before other information can be entered into WARES. A         
complete account definition requires associated records in several other      
windows, as shown in the table below.

Addresses are used on warehouse receipts, bills of lading, invoices, and      
standard billing letters. This information is also used to log contacts and   
write letters using the Memos window, which is accessed from the Accounts     
Setup or Addresses window with softkey [SF2].   
        
Charges for accessorial services and customary warehouse handling and         
storage are entered in the Setup Tariffs window on the Billing menu.
        
ACCOUNT SETUP     
        
Begin setting up an account by selecting Setup/Accounts from the main menu    
bar. The first prompt, account, requires a unique identifier. This ID can be  
up to 8 characters long in any combination of letters and numbers. A common   
practice is to use a 3 or 4-letter acronym of the account's name; the ID for  
Customware Solutions, Inc. could be CSI, for example. Type an identifier and  
press <Enter>.

SETUP       ACCOUNTS
================================================================================

        
At the Firm Name prompt, enter the full name of this account. When names      
are typed in all lower case, WARES knows to capitalize the first letter of    
each word.        
        
Mail to: is the street address or postal box number where correspondence      
will be sent. If the account address was not entered previously, press        
[AF10] at the mail to prompt to enter an address record for the account. In   
the Addresses window, enter a type code 'A' in the address type to show that  
this record is for an Account address.
        
Fill in the account name and street (mailing) address. Next fill in the ZIP   
Code. WARES will verify the format of U.S. (5 or 9 digits) or Canadian (6     
alternating letters and numbers) postal codes. WARES also maintains a         
cross-reference of Zip codes against city & state. When a ZIP is recognized,  
WARES will offer defaults for the city & state. Accept the defaults by        
pressing <Enter> in the city and state fields.  
        
Following the street address is a multi-line field for the account's phone    
numbers. A standard 7- or 10- digit number will be automatically formatted    
to (nnn) nnn-nnnn. You may include extensions or notes (such as FAX).         
        
The Contact/Salutation/Position area is used to address correspondence:       
invoices, dunning notices, and letters. Invoices will be sent attention the   
first entry on the contacts list. Enter the contact name in the format        
"Title Firstname Lastname" and WARES will produce a proper salutation         
default for letters.        
        
At the Prepaid prompt, the word "Options" appears on the status line. Press   
[F2] to select an entry of either Prepaid, Collect, or 3rd Party Prepaid.     
This sets the default choice on all shipments for this account. The default   
can be overridden for any individual shipment.  
        
Send Freight Bills to: must be left blank until the account record has been   
completed and saved. If the account pays freight bills through an auditor     
or freight payment plan, an address record must be setup for the freight      
payer address. Otherwise freight bills will be sent to the Bill to: address   
on the left side of the account window.         
        
When the account address is complete, press [F9] to save the record and then  
<Esc> to return to the Account setup window.    
        
The final section of this window sets up important accounting information     
for the account. For more detailed explanations, see the help records for     
each field by pressing [F1]. These fields should be selected from their       
Options popups using [F2]. Invoicing controls when and how often this         
account is invoiced. Receiving affects how storage charges are calculated     
for the period when a lot is received, and Recurring determines on what       
basis recurring storage charges are calculated.

An entry in the Purchase Order No. field will appear as a default reference   
number on invoices. The final field, Custom Periods, takes a schedule of      
custom period close dates if any apply. When all fields are complete save     
the account record by pressing [F9]. The record may be recalled after saving  
by pressing Alt-O, then <Enter>.      
        
After entering the account, enter products and then put in the starting       
inventory balances through a receipt. These steps are described in the menu   
help documents for Setup/Products, Contacts/Addresses and Entry/Receipts.     
        
ACCOUNT STATUS    
        
When a new account record is saved, the record status is set to 2. In a       
multiuser installation, the status of each active account record should be    
set to 4 or 5 to prevent accidental modification. Prospective and inactive    
accounts can be indicated with a status of 0 or 1, which will exclude them    
from account reports and invoice calculations. Correspondence and proposed    
rates may be entered and maintained for prospects and inactive accounts.      
        
The account record status is set in the Record Attributes window. Press       
[F10],W,A to display the attributes window and change the status. Press       
[F9],[F9] to save both the attribute information and the account record.      
        
ADDRESSES DEFINITIONS.      
        
After entering and saving an account record, you should set up the  
account's addresses. Access the Addresses Entry window by pressing [AF1]      
from the Account Setup window, or select Contacts/Addresses from the menus.   
        
Fill in the Freight Pay, FOB, and COD fields for each consignee. Entering Y   
at COD places the consignee on credit hold, and will require entry of the     
COD charge while entering any shipment to this consignee. 
        
Address identifiers may be acronyms similar to account identifiers, or        
you may choose to accept the system default sequenced identifier. Where an    
account assigns a store number or location code for addresses, you may want   
to use this number for the consignee code; for instance, KM401 for Kid-Mart   
store 401.

SETUP       PRODUCTS
================================================================================

Each product stored in the warehouse is defined by a record on this entry     
window. The product is linked to a specific account by the account  
identifier. The product window maintains product codes and descriptions,      
conversion factors, weights, and freight classifications. Product fees are    
defined by associating the product record with a billing tariff. To display   
tariffs for this product, press [AF9] to jump to the Setup Tariffs window.    
        
Product information is divided into a series of categories:         
        
Descriptions (Product, Description, Stock Number) identify products.
Factors (Piece/Pallet, Pallet/Stack and so forth) are used to convert units.  
Weights (Weight/Piece, Weight Storage Tare, ...) are used in calculations.    
Codes (Product Group, Serialize, ...) organize products for processing.       
Freight classes (NMFC_Code, LTL_Class, TL_Class) are for bills of lading.     
Quantities (Received, Available, Balance, etc.) display stock levels.         
        
Quantities are changed by warehouse receipts, shipment orders, and  
adjustments, and can be viewed but not edited on this window. Press [SF4] to  
see the product quantities in a sub-window. Factors are used when entering    
warehouse receipts to convert from pieces quantities to storage and weight    
units and vice versa.       
        
The status of each completed product record should be set to prevent
accidental modification. (A status of 3 or 4 is recommended.)

================================================================================

National Motor Freight Carrier (NMFC) codes are used for the freight
itemization on bills of lading. The bill of lading long form contains two     
itemizations. The first itemization on the bill of lading is a product        
manifest or packing list. Following this is a freight manifest in which       
goods are tallied by NMFC code. When NMFC codes are used, all like goods are  
lumped together in the freight manifest portion of the bill of lading. The    
freight manifest description is taken from the NMFC code table and not from   
the product.      
        
NMFC codes are used to classify goods shipped in interstate commerce. These   
codes provide a database of standard freight descriptions to be used with     
uniform freight bills. Associated with the NMFC code is a declared release    
value for carriage of the goods. A compendium of NMFC codes, Standard         
Carrier Alpha Codes (SCAC) for identifying carriers, and so forth is
available from:   
        
     Attn: Traffic Department         
     American Trucking Association    
     2200 Mill Road         
     Alexandria, VA  22314  
        
The actual database of NMFC codes and descriptions is very large. Only a few  
of the codes and descriptions are needed for any account, so those codes      
are entered and maintained on this window. Each code record has a principal   
description and provision for sub-codes with sub-descriptions. Also, each     
code has default freight rate classification codes for LTL and TL freight     
rating. 
        
Codes can be entered directly on the NMFC Codes Table, or can be entered      
during the Product entry process. When the NMFC field is reached on the       
Product Window, press [F2] and select the appropriate code. If the correct    
code does not exist in the table, press [AF10] on the NMFC field to jump to   
the NMFC Codes Table. Enter the correct code, save the changes to the table   
using [F9], and press <Esc> to return to the Product Window. The correct      
code will be immediately available. Using this method to enter codes ensures  
that only the necessary codes are entered.

SETUP       BALANCES
================================================================================

Certain mistakes in transactions can result in posting inconsistencies on     
lot and product balances. For example, two receipts posted to the same lot    
but with different storage factors (pieces per pallet) may cause an 
erroneous storage count. Correcting the source transactions does not always   
correct the balances on the lot or product records. Most commonly these       
problems crop up during shipment entry. If an error message that the storage  
units or weight available is less than the amount selected occurs, run the    
Product Balances utility.   
        
The Product Balances utility corrects totals on product records to match the  
quantities of detail lots for the products. On hand amounts reflect the       
totals of the on-hand balances of lots for a product. Reserved amounts are    
the totals of the reserved balances for product lots. Available amounts are   
the on-hand less the reserve.         
        
The balance rebuilding programs allow records to be selected for rebuild by   
product, by account, or by other index. If no selection is made, all records  
in the database will be rebuilt. Rebuilding balances for the entire database  
may take a long time. However, these routines may be interrupted by pressing  
<Escape> during execution.

SETUP         UNPOST
================================================================================

Shipment and adjustment transactions may be reversed, or unposted, using the  
Unpost Transaction utility. Use this selection when an adjustment or
shipment record is not posted correctly, and the record cannot be reversed    
from the window by setting the status to 0 (held). Reversing and reposting a  
transaction should correct any posting problem. 
        
The unpost function will not reverse transactions which have been billed or   
closed. Billed transactions must first be unbilled by changing the status to  
3 (Verified) before reversing. A closed transaction cannot be reversed        
without reversing the invoice batch which closed the transaction.   
        
This utility will allow balances on detail lots to go negative (less than     
zero on hand). Adjustment transactions which create lots may be reversed.     
This will change the created lot balance, but the lot record itself will not  
be deleted.

SETUP OVERVIEW.   
        
This topic outlines the procedures to configure WARES for your warehouse      
company. Warehouse configuration options are available only when logged in    
at the highest access level. For information about password security and      
access levels, see related article TOPIC*SECURITY.        
        
The steps to start using WARES can be divided into two sections, as shown     
in the table below. For each step, the corresponding menu selection and the   
documentation manual section and article name are listed. Refer to these      
articles and the on-line help for detailed instructions in each step.

The first group of steps initialize the data volume and define printers for   
the hardware environment. Next the warehouse company, addresses, buildings    
and locations should be entered. Later, an account record and related         
products, tariffs, and inventory must be entered for each warehouse account.  
This third group of steps is illustrated in the guided tour for adding a new  
account, and explained in the document TOPICS*ACCOUNTS.   
        
WARES ENVIRONMENT.
        
Configuring the printer environment for each WARES user is the first step in  
setting up WARES. On a multiuser system, realize that each user will have an  
independent environment. Use the Printer Environment window to define system  
printers for the logged in user. (If no driver exists for a printer, you may  
need to define a driver using the Printer Definitions window.)      
        
From the main menu, selection Tools/Reports/Setup Printers will display       
the Printer Environment window. With the cursor in the first row of the       
Printer Type column, press [F2] for a popup of the printer drivers available  
in WARES. Use the arrow keys to highlight the driver for your letter-quality  
printer and press <Enter>. If necessary, repeat the process in the second     
row of Printer Type to select the driver for your forms printer. When your    
selections are complete, press [F9] to save, and <Esc> until you are back at  
the main menu. (Your changes may not appear on the popup unless you select    
Access/Reset before returning to Access/Printers.)

When the Invoice Control window appears, the fields displayed above should    
be filled in with default values. Accept these values, or enter through the   
window and make any required changes. For instance, at This Acctg Period you  
should enter the number of your current fiscal year accounting period. Enter  
the first day of this month in Bill Period Start (use MMDDYY format, without  
any slashes or dashes), and the first day of the next month in Next Period    
Start. Press [F9] to save the control record after entering through all the   
fields in the window.       
        
To return to the volume control window later, select Tools/Define/Controls    
from the main menu. In the Controls Entry window, press [F2] and select       
identifier VOLUME*CTL from the popup. 
        
WAREHOUSE COMPANY.
        
The next step is to enter the information to define your company. Select      
Setup/Warehouse to view the Warehouse Company Information window. Fill out    
the company name, and enter addresses as required.        
        
To enter an address, press [AF10] from any of the address identifier fields.  
Enter an address identifier, and put "C" in the type field of the address.    
Fill out the rest of the address information, save the address with [F9],     
and press <Esc> to return to the Warehouse Company Information window. Then   
enter the address record identifier in the Warehouse Company window.
        
LIMITATION FOR DAMAGES.     
        
The warehouse company may state a limitation for damages per unit of good,

article, or by weight. The warehouse default value for damages is entered     
here. The account's declared value of merchandise is entered on the account   
or on individual products, if the account declares a value different than     
this default. The limitation entry is required. 
        
To perfect the warehouse lien, receipts should be due upon receipt. The       
usual invoiced receipts message is, "DUE UPON RECEIPT. REFER TO INVOICE WITH  
PAYMENT." For receipts which are not invoiced, you may wish to add a message  
such as "NOT AN INVOICE. DO NOT PAY FROM THIS DOCUMENT." Refer to the         
related topics for more details about warehouse contracts and company setup.  
        
WAREHOUSE BUILDINGS.        
        
After entering the warehouse company, the next step is to set up information  
about buildings and the locations within each building. Each separate         
building street address for the warehouse company requires a separate         
record, entered from menu selection Contacts/Addresses. Receipts, shipments   
and adjustments all require the correct building number for the product(s)    
in question. The building names and addresses entered on this window are      
printed on the warehouse receipt with the titles "Received By:" and 
"Received At:", respectively.         
        
Most warehouses number buildings in series starting with "1", or with         
letters starting with "A". Enter your desired building number rather than     
accepting the address identifier default. Fill in the name (usually the same  
as the company name) and street address, city, state, and ZIP code of the     
building, then press [F9] to save the record. Repeat the process until all    
your building records have been created.        
        
TIP: For similar building addresses, use the Alt-O (old entry value) key to   
paste entries from the previous address into the current record.    
buildings have identical addresses, press Alt-C after entering the new        
building number to copy the previous record into the current record.
        
BUILDING LOCATIONS.         
        
Location codes are from menu selection Setup/Locations. Location codes        
divide the area of each building into zones, rooms, aisles, aisles and rows,  
racks, racks and slots, or virtually any other location arrangement.
        
Within a building, each unique set of starting letters for a location         
identifies a group of location codes. The code group may be subdivided        
using one, two or three ranges of letters and numbers. The following rules    
apply to location code entries.       
        
  *  The code must consist of letters only,     
  *  Each code must be unique within a building,
  *  Each code may have no, one, or two numeric ranges associated with it.    
  *  Numeric ranges may be separated by a letter delimiter or a dash.

================================================================================

        
In the first field enter the number of the building for which you are         
defining locations, then enter the starting letters for a code in the next    
field. As you fill out each code record with numeric ranges and delimiters,   
the description field will automatically show you how the codes will appear   
on WARES documents. If you want only one numeric range on a code, but would   
like the code letter and range number to be separated by a dash (easier to    
read), leave the First Range fields blank and enter data in the Second        
Range. After entering each location code, press [F9] to save it. Remember,    
codes must be created separately for each warehouse building.       
        
TIP: You should define a "dummy" code for each building which does not        
reference an actual location. This is because when entering an adjustment     
you may not know the actual location of the lot you wish to adjust. In such   
a case you can enter your "dummy" location code, after which WARES will

TRANSACTION NUMBERING.      
        
WARES uses special processing logic to assign transaction numbers for         
documents which have related files or for which archives are maintained.      
This logic consists of checking that an assigned number does not exist in     
any related file, that the number is not already on the current file, and     
that the number is not assigned to an active entry. The following file        
relationships are checked:

Table 3 outlines how account orders (940 Warehouse Shipping Order) are        
received through EDI*Atlas and processed in WARES. Shipments for these        
orders then generate response documents such as the 945 Warehouse Shipping    
Advice, 204 Motor Carrier Shipment Information, and 856 Ship Notice/Manifest  
which are transmitted through the EDI Provider back to the account. 
        
Table 4 charts the user interactions in the above 940/945 process. In step    
B.1, select Exchange/Interchange/Receive to download EDI documents. This

The warehouse staff corrects and posts entries on held orders in step C.2.    
Step C.3 reviews posted Orders for product availability per account 
instructions. Then orders are built into allocated Shipments in step C.4.     
        
In steps D.1 and D.2, allocated shipments are reviewed for completeness and   
forms are printed. Completed shipments are changed to status 3 (Verified)

INVENTORY REPORTING.        
        
The 846 Inventory Inquiry/Advice transaction set allows trading partners to   
reconcile their inventory with your records.    
        
PROCESS.
        
The Inventory 846 process first displays a Select Details (XQ) collector      
window. Use the index selection options to specify the criteria for the lots  
you wish to include in the Advice records. Then press [F9] to create the      
transaction sets. 
        
Each completed transaction set is written to the TRANSMITS file, and will be  
sent during the next EDI Transmit. One or more advice transactions will be    
created depending on the number of lot detail records being reported.         
        
  
        
PROGRAM NOTES.    
        
Process record EDI_846 controls 846 inventory reporting. 846 reporting could  
be automated by scheduling this process. The EDI documents are built by       
program POST_EDI.TRANSMIT. The parameters for this program are:     
        
     846the transaction set identifier,         
     PARTNER_846  the dictionary fieldname that evaluates to a partner key,   
     DETAILS      and the name of the file being processed.         
        
The 846 process selects only inventory lots with quantity greater than zero   
for reporting, and the lots are sorted by account and then stock number.      
        
The DETAILS dictionary field PARTNER_846 is evaluated for each record to      
determine the partner identifier, and a reporting break occurs whenever the   
partner identifier changes. Lot records with a null partner key, without an   
846 map, or where the map status is less than 2 will not be reported. (The    
PARTNER_846 dictionary returns null when an 846 map is not found.)  
        
  
        
TRANSFERRING EDI DATA THROUGH FTP     
        
Traditional EDI uses store-and-forward mail service bureaus, or Value Added   
Networks (VANs) to transfer data. These networks provide data consolidation,  
distribution, and storage, and reporting and other services to guarantee      
reliable data transfer. Desktop e-mail software cannot replace the functions  
of a VAN, because e-mail lacks the automation, data replication, and
consolidation and distribution functions which a VAN provides. However, EDI   
data may be transferred using FTP (File Transfer Protocol) through an         
Internet Service Provider (ISP) without recourse to a VAN.

In the table above, all the receiving functions can be performed in one       
program step in EDI*Atlas, using the Exchange/Interchange/Receive menu        
selection. All that is required is to replace the CONNECT.BAT operating       
system file with a program to perform the FTP file copy.  
        
The transmit process is more problematic when trading with multiple 
partners. The default EDI*Atlas process bundles all data to transmit into     
one file, to be parsed and distributed by the VAN. A replacement process      
which would transmit data for each partner separately, sending it to the      
correct FTP site, would be required.

IMPORT FILE SPECIFICATIONS  
        
The WARES program supports data import using either flat files or EDI. EDI    
is preferred because it is standards based, allows flexible mapping specific  
to each partnership, and provides full control and auditing of the exchange   
process. EDI standards are supported for versions 003060.X12 and later.

files cannot be used for data import. For ASCII files, each row is CR/LF      
terminated, fields are separated by Tab delimiters (Hex 09), and values are   
separated by vertical bars "|" (Hex 7C).        
        
Programming for importing flat files does not use a mapper, as EDI does.

DIAL OVERVIEW.    
        
WARES includes Dial-In Access Link (DIAL), which allows your accounts to      
log in to WARES under a special user ID with restricted access. These         
restrictions provide complete security in your system for other accounts'     
information as well as for overall data integrity. For instructions on        
installing the DIAL features for an account, see technical note 90042.        
        
Warehouse accounts frequently request information about Electronic Document   
Interchange, or EDI, thinking that EDI allows them to see information in the  
warehouse computer system. Accounts with low transaction volume may want      
DIAL instead of "real" EDI. For X12 standard EDI accounts, DIAL may be the    
missing piece of the communications puzzle -- an exclusive WARES feature.     
        
DIAL SECURITY.    
        
Think of DIAL as a "cloaking device." A user operating under DIAL can access  
information for a single account ID which is determined by the warehouse.     
Records for any other account are completely locked out. Should the user      
enter a record ID which belongs to someone else, DIAL will reject the entry.  
The DIAL menu selections are limited to just those options which would        
concern the account. The following program features are available:  
        
     Products Setup         
     Warehouse Receipts Entry         
     Pending Orders Entry   
     Shipment Orders Entry  
     Lot Detail Inventory Review      
     DIAL Reports 
        
The account can use these screens to review product, receipt, order,
shipment, and lot detail records, including history. The account may also     
enter new products, receipts, orders, and shipments. The status default       
under DIAL is lowered to 0 (Unposted). While the account can raise a
record's status from 0 to 1 (Reserved), records of status 1 or higher cannot  
be changed inside DIAL. Thus no account entries can have ANY effect in the    
database until you review them for accuracy and raise their status to 2 or    
higher. This feature completely protects the warehouse data integrity.        
        
DIAL REPORTS.     
        
The DIAL menu Reports choice allows accounts to view or print reports.        
Reports can be made available to every DIAL user, or restricted to one        
intended user or more. To add a report for every DIAL account, enter "CU"     
in the Group field of that report control record. To provide a report to a    
single DIAL account, add that account's logon name to the Group entries of    
the report control record. Once again, only the account's own inventory       
records will be included in any of these reports.

TOPICS       PICKING
================================================================================

There are a number of different methods of order picking used in public       
warehousing. This section discusses these methods, and how WARES supports     
each.   
        
The first method is simple stock location. In this scheme, each lot of        
product received is stored in a single, unique location, and lots are never   
broken up among multiple locations within the warehouse. When using WARES in  
a stock location environment, the location of a particular lot is entered     
only once, when the warehouse receipt record is entered into the system.      
To withdraw the lot and clear the location, the user need only select the     
lot's control number during shipment order entry. The lot's location is       
automatically recorded on the shipping documents, and once the shipment is    
posted (saved with a status of 2 or higher) the lot is removed from the       
location on the system. If for some reason a lot is moved from one location   
to another in the warehouse, this transaction is reflected on the system by   
a location transfer (available on the Entry menu). See related Topics for     
more information. 
        
In an open picking environment, lots are often spread across several
locations. The warehouse may maintain a separate location for damaged units;  
and goods received over a period of time may be received under the same       
control number but placed in different locations. Under these circumstances,  
proper stock rotation can be a concern. WARES is designed to maintain proper  
FIFO control automatically. 
        
When a lot is first received in the warehouse, the location to which it is    
assigned becomes the primary location. Subsequent receipts under the same     
control number may be assigned to this or any other location. When product    
is withdrawn from the lot the system will automatically draw down the         
primary location first, since it contains the oldest product. Once the        
primary location is depleted, the system will begin to draw from the
next-earliest location until it is depleted, and so on. During shipment       
entry the system will determine automatically which locations must be used    
to fulfill the order, based on the quantities available in the primary and    
secondary locations against the quantity shipped. It may be the case that     
the primary location does not contain enough product to fulfill the order.    
While only the primary location will display in the Location field on the     
screen, shipment documents will show all the locations necessary to fully     
pick the order.   
        
Under an open picking system, product which constitutes part of a lot may     
need to be moved between locations. To move partial lots use the Inventory    
Adjustment Entry window (see related Topics for more information), and        
create an adjustment consisting of two detail lines. On the first line,       
adjust the product level DOWN in the location being moved FROM, and on the    
second line adjust the level UP in the location being moved TO.     
        
WARES can also be configured to support a pick line, where product is always  
drawn from a single picking location, and this location is replenished from

an arbitrary number of secondary or bulk locations. If your warehouse uses    
this system for a product, the picking location is entered in the   
Bldg*Locatn field on the Maintain Inventory Product Information window. This  
then becomes the primary location for ALL lots of this product. During        
shipment entry, whenever the quantity shipped will fully deplete the picking  
location, the system displays a message instructing the operator to enter an  
adjustment to replenish the primary location. A popup will also display,      
showing the primary location and all other locations where the lot being      
shipped against resides, and the quantity available in each. Even if the      
picking location has been fully depleted, it will still display first on the  
location popup during shipment entry, with a quantity available of 0.         
Likewise, the pick location will always print first on shipping documents,    
which automatically notifies order pickers in the warehouse to move product   
from a secondary location to the pick location.
