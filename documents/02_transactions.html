<span id="transactions"></span><h1>Document Lines Detail<a class="headerlink" href="#document-lines-detail" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Document lines provide the transactions for inventory control and location
tracking. These lines contain identifying, control, descriptive, and
quantitative information for each product, lot, and (optionally) storage unit
in a facility.</p>
<p>A subset of document line columns is used for summary lines entry, as shown in
the following view.</p>
<img alt="_images/lines-1blank.png" src="_images/lines-1blank.png" />
<p>The sumary document line entry uses product record default values for most
values. When received goods require specific information different from
these defaults, a document line detail view is required.</p>
<p>Document line detail entry is divided into two sections: descriptive entries,
and quantities. The following sections of this topic give examples of summary
line entries, and corresponding detail entries which add to individual lines.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The summary and detail lines which follow use the following conventions:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>Yellow &#8211; highlights summary lines which are selected for detail display.</li>
<li>Dark Green &#8211; indicates entries which are pulled from the Product, or
which could not be changed in this example.</li>
<li>When INNER UOM is left blank on a product, INNER quantities will not be
enterable on transaction lines.</li>
<li>Dark Gray &#8211; indicates default values which could have been changed if
need be, but were not changed in the displayed example.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="unit-weights-and-measures">
<h2>Unit Weights and Measures<a class="headerlink" href="#unit-weights-and-measures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The classic individual unit entry is roll paper, where accurate unit weights and
measures are required for shipping and billing. Below is an entry lines list,
where each roll has a unique foot linear measure and a unique net weight.</p>
<img alt="_images/lines-2rolls.png" src="_images/lines-2rolls.png" />
<p>The details for one line are shown below. Every entry for the roll was
available in the summary line entry, and no changes were made in the detail.
The roll net weight of 2611 Lbs, entered in the summary list view, is close to
a default weight of 2616.38 lbs, calculated from the content value of .58
lbs/ft.</p>

<div class="section" id="partial-and-mixed-pallets">
<h2>Partial and Mixed Pallets<a class="headerlink" href="#partial-and-mixed-pallets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When goods are handled pallet-in, pallet-out, tracking mixed pallets may seem
unnecessary. However, a number of circumstances result in mixed units or
pallets in every warehouse:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Part of a unit may have damage. Damaged and whole goods must be listed with
separate content lines.</li>
<li>If damaged content is replaced with make-up goods from a different lot, then
separate content lines are needed to track the two lots.</li>
<li>Pallet units may contain lot remainders transferred in from a production
line or even from another distribution center.</li>
<li>Multiple products may be shipped on mixed pallets to reduce shipping costs.
The warehouse may choose to lump the goods and not segregate them if picking
from mixed pallets is not problematic.</li>
<li>Inconsistent pallets may be received due to storage requirements in previous
warehousing.</li>
<li>Stripping a floor-loaded container may result in a hand-full of remainders
for multiple products or lots, which get lumped on a mixed pallet.</li>
</ul>
<p>We talk about not having mixed pallets when actually we do have them.</p>
<p>By default, webWARES combines unit and content data in a single entry line. In
contrast, mixed pallet units start with a parent line that omits content values
for <strong>Product</strong>, <strong>Variety</strong>, or Lot <strong>Control</strong>, but includes a required parent
<strong>UnitID</strong>. (Without the <strong>UnitID</strong>, there would be no way to distinguish a
mixed unit from a series of partial units.)</p>
<p>Subsequent child content lines will include <strong>Product</strong>, <strong>Variety</strong>, or Lot
<strong>Control</strong> values, followed by the <strong>UnitID</strong>. Repeating the <strong>UnitID</strong>
triggers the association of the mixed child content to the parent &#8220;unit only&#8221;
line.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="first admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p class="last">In addition to sharing <strong>UnitID</strong> and <strong>Location</strong>, mixed unit and content
lines have the same <strong>LineKey</strong> (see <a class="reference internal" href="#cryptic-data"><em>Line Data not Displayed</em></a>). Every document
line has an entry for <strong>LineKey</strong>, while the <strong>UnitID</strong> value is optional on
other lines and is surely missing with bulk entries.</p>
</div>
<img alt="_images/lines-3mixed.png" src="_images/lines-3mixed.png" />
<p>Repeating the <strong>UnitID</strong> causes the following changes to line detail values.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Child content <strong>Location</strong> is filled from the parent unit and protected.</li>
<li><strong>Count Per</strong> on child content is cleared and protected; this does not apply
to mixed pallets.</li>
<li>Unit <strong>Tare Weight</strong> and unit <strong>Quantity</strong> are cleared and protected on child
content lines.</li>
<li>Entries for unit partial weights and partial measures are auto-calculated
based on the content quantity, and these entries are filled and protected.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the parent unit line will have the following entries:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The unit <strong>Quantity</strong>, which is always filled/protected, will show &#8220;1&#8221;.</li>
<li>The unit <strong>Tare Weight</strong> will be taken from the product for the first child
content line.</li>
<li>The unit <strong>Net Weight</strong>, <strong>Volume</strong>, and <strong>Quantity</strong> entries will be the sum
of these entries from the child content lines.</li>
<li>The parent unit line entries for <strong>Product</strong>, <strong>Variety</strong>, and <strong>Control</strong>
will be cleared and protected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Detail for the highlighted line is shown below. Every entry but one, the
<strong>Condition</strong>, came from either product default values or the summary line
entry.</p>
<img alt="_images/lines-3-detail.png" src="_images/lines-3-detail.png" />
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="first admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>There seem to be two entry procedures for lines, but actually:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>Entering two consecutive content lines with the same <strong>UnitID</strong> will
trigger a question, &#8220;Do these entries belong to the same unit? (Yes/no).&#8221;
Answering &#8220;Yes&#8221; will create the parent unit line and update the child
content lines as described previously.</li>
<li>Enterig a unit record without product content information, followed by
child content records repeating the <strong>UnitID</strong>, will produce the same
result without having to ask the question.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="unit-tracking">
<h2>Unit Tracking<a class="headerlink" href="#unit-tracking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Where each unit of a truck load is tied to unique information, the units must
be entered separately in the lines summary. Values which make individual line
entries necessary include varying <strong>Lot Control</strong> numbers and <strong>Location</strong>,
individual <strong>Unit ID</strong>, and varying weights or measures per unit. An example
truck load unit entry is shown in the following figure.</p>
<img alt="_images/lines-4units.png" src="_images/lines-4units.png" />
<p>The details for the highlighted line are displayed to demonstrate the entries
which commonly change from unit to unit. Each unit in the example has a unique
<strong>NetWeight</strong>, for example.</p>
<img alt="_images/lines-4-detail.png" src="_images/lines-4-detail.png" />
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="first admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p class="last">Sometimes unique values are required for both <strong>NetWeight</strong> and
<strong>GrossWeight</strong>, but the program does not store gross weight. Since gross
weight is by definition greated than net weight, entering gross weight in the
unit <strong>TareWeight</strong> field will calculate the <strong>TareWeight</strong> as the difference
between the two weights. Then the gross weight can be rederived from the two
entries at any time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bulk-versus-unit-entry">
<h2>Bulk Versus Unit Entry<a class="headerlink" href="#bulk-versus-unit-entry" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many truck loads consist of 20 or more units, all uniform, to be stored in a
single bay location and moved load-in load-out. The work of entering each unit
on a line is unnecessary in that case. In the previous example, if the units
had been uniform, the load could have been entered as a single bulk line as
shown below.</p>
<img alt="_images/lines-5bulk.png" src="_images/lines-5bulk.png" />
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="first admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p class="last">On bulk entry lines, the line detail will show the unit count as the content
<strong>Quantity</strong> divided by the content <strong>Count Per</strong>, plus 1 for any remainder.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-line-detail-entries">
<h2>Using Line Detail Entries<a class="headerlink" href="#using-line-detail-entries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Line detail entries are necessary when entering unique values which are not
visible in the summary. Specific cases where this might occur are listed here.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Damaged goods must be entered in separate content records which are marked
in the details.</li>
<li>Marks, variable descriptions, or special lot notes are entered in details.</li>
<li>Broken cases or sampled bags should be entered separately, noting the shorted
inner quantities.</li>
<li>Content count discrepancies on receiving are entered in the <strong>Over/Short</strong>
value, as positive or negative numbers. <strong>Over/Short</strong> applies to content
only, and only on receipt, where content is a visually countable quantity
(cartons, cases, bags, etc.).</li>
<li>Variable tare weights or gross weights are entered in the details view,
unlike consistent tare weights which are entered on the product setup.</li>
<li>When unit weight varies, linear counts or volumetric measures probably vary
too. This is especially important with hazardous materials, where both
weights and volume measures are used on the Bill of Lading.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="line-data-not-displayed">
<span id="cryptic-data"></span><h2>Line Data not Displayed<a class="headerlink" href="#line-data-not-displayed" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some document line data may not be included in a view, but is required for
program operation. These columns are described in the following list.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>SequenceKey</strong> &#8211; The program assigns a unique key to each document line.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>TransactionType</strong> and <strong>Transaction</strong> &#8211; are required back references
from the document header, and these columns organize lines in lot or location
detail displays.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>LineKey</strong> &#8211; is necessary to maintain the original document structure for
for shipping and receiving documents. Pick tickets are printed with lines
sorted by Location, but Warehouse Receipts and Bills of Lading are sorted in
the original document order, that is, by <strong>Linekey</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>LineKey</strong> tracks the initial entry sequence of lines in a document:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><cite>LINEKEY = ( TRANSACTION * 1000 ) + LINEPOS</cite></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Where units (pallets) with mixed lots are received or shipped, or where
fungible order quantities are expanded to be filled by multiple unit picks,
several transaction lines with unique <strong>SequenceKey</strong> and varying
<strong>Location</strong> entries may have the same <strong>LineKey</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Status</strong> &#8211; is determined from assigning unit numbers when unit tracking
is used, from picking, staging and loading activities, and from releasing
completed documents, applying charges, and inviocing.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>PostDate</strong> &#8211; is copied from the transaction header and applies to all
lines in a document. The <strong>Postdate</strong> of a document should be finalized at
the date and time that the warehouse signs a receipt or a carrier signs for
a shipment.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>ContentOnHand</strong>, <strong>InnerOnHand</strong>, <strong>ContentReserve</strong>, <strong>InnerReserve</strong> &#8211;
The user interface shows Content and Inner Quantities, but these quantities
are actually represented in the data as either <strong>_Reserve</strong> or <strong>_OnHand</strong>
depending on the line status. The appearance of a single data field is
deceptive from the standpoint of data definition.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Account</strong> &#8211; is copied from the transaction header for positive-quantity
lines (receipts and adjustments), and an error is generated when a product
record with the Account, Product, and Variety does not exist. Therefore new
lots on a document always belong to the master account of the document.</p>
<p>Shipments may withdraw only from lots belonging to the document&#8217;s account.</p>
<p>Adjustments may withdraw from any lot regardless of the account in the
document heading. Therefore adjustments can effect ownership transfers, where
negative-quantity adjustment lines deduct from one owner account and positive
lines add to the owner account listed in the adjustment header.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>UnitUOM</strong>, <strong>ContentUOM</strong>, and <strong>InnerUOM</strong> &#8211; are display-only values
copied from the current product record.</p>
