Data Exchange Documentation
=================================

Contents:

WARES on the web uses web-oriented formatting standards based on JSON (Java 
Script Object Notation) to exchange data internally and with external partners. 
JSON is a public standard and extensive resources for validation and exchange 
of data are freely available on a variety of websites.

WARES has supported EDI data exchange in the past, but ANSI-X12 EDI is now 
deprecated due to the proprietary nature of these standards and their lack of 
adaptability to web services. 

However, the `WARES EDI Documentation <edi.aaltsys.info>`_ site fully documents 
EDI standards and their use in a warehouse context.
