JSON Exchange Protocols

Automated data exchange between unconnected computer software systems presents 
a number of challenges. This article compares the strengths and weaknesses of 
legacy EDI and web-based data exchange alternatives to explain how WARES can 
achieve reliable data transfer using modern, simple, and familiar data format 
standards and exchange protocols.

Data Formats -- ASC-X12 EDI
=============================

ASC-X12 EDI IS A legacy system based on standards for structuring data into a 
fixed set of business documents such as invoices, payments, purchase orders, 
and so forth. Many large enterprises have adopted ASC-X12 EDI expecting that 
the formal procedures inherent in this technology will avoid exchange problems. 
However, the data structuring aspect of traditional EDI is problematic:

*  EDI is limited in its ability to exchange characters outside of the symbols 
   found on a standard typewriter, and text elements are length-limited. 
*  EDI uses in-stream data separators which are not restricted from inclusion 
   in data elements by traditional EDI implementations. 
*  EDI data is not labeled, so it is not human readable and interpretation is
   dependent on reference to external standards. 
*  Reference to external standards prevents EDI from being incorporated in any 
   programming language as an extension or otherwise. 
*  Messages are limited to the predefined documents included in the standards.
*  Document structures are inherently archaic, having been developed prior to 
   the introduction of modern relational databases, newer structured schema 
   data systems, and any modern programming languages. 
*  Periodically new versions of document standards are issued, and the 
   structure of each document varies from version to version.
*  Each document definition attempts to cover all possible content variations,
   resulting in an implementation craft guaranteeing employment to a cadre of 
   EDI mapping specialists who are otherwise unskilled in IT. 
*  X12 standards are proprietary, and the table data for any one version of the 
   standards costs $20,000 or more. [#]_ 

Any one of the above issues would be a stumbling block in the current world of 
web-based systems and open-source software and standards. 

Legacy EDI does have a few strengths:

*  Compactness: the EDI data stream is almost pure data.
*  Typing: EDI standards impose data typing and format specifications for every 
   data element. Format specifications are usually limited to min/max length, 
   although specific forms are used for items such as dates and times. 
*  Code validation: EDI standards include extensive lists of code values for 
   adding semantic content to data. Codes precede many data elements to remove 
   ambiguity.

Data Formats -- JSON & XML
=============================

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and 
JavaScript form a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web. [#]_
Of these technologies, JavaScript constitutes a programming paradigm capable of
adding dynamic content for web browsers. 

Independent of programming languages, two competing methods for representing 
structured data in both human-readable and machine-readable form are **XML** 
(eXtensible Markup Language) and **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation). XML 
provides a structured extension to HTML's static web markup, while JSON was 
developed to provide structured data for JavaScript implementations. While JSON 
is a much newer development than XML, it should be obvious why it is now the 
*de facto* preferred format for data exchange using web services: it works with 
JavaScript.

JSON has a few weaknesses:

*  While XML has the concept of data schema, JSON does not. 
*  JSON data is weakly typed, as is its target language JavaScript.
*  JSON parsing does not address vulnerabilities such as injection attacks.
*  JSON has a few minor incompatibilities with superset encodings such as YAML.
*  JSON encodes an object, but there is no general specification for streaming 
   multiple objects as would be required in data exchange.

Exchange Protocols -- EDI
=============================

EDI is designed to stream data documents over unreliable connections, and there 
are extensive features incorporated in EDI specifications to guarantee reliable
data delivery. EDI is based on the concept of store-and-forward mail delivery 
and batch processing of data streams.

       JavaScript is part of the triad of technologies that all Web developers 
       must learn: HTML to specify the content of web pages, CSS to specify the 
       presentation of web pages, and JavaScript to specify the behaviour of 
       web pages.
