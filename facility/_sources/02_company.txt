The Warehouse Company
=============================

Each warehouse facility requires a Warehouse Company information record.
This record defines the default warehouse limitation of liability statement for 
warehouse receipts, links to company addresses, and message statements for 
warehouse receipts and other invoices.

Company Identifier and Name
=============================

A unique company identifier must be entered for the facility. This value is 
used to associate contact address records to the warehouse company.

Limitation of Liability
=============================

WARES requires entries for the **Liability Limit** value and **Per** code, 
which combine to produce the **Liability Limit** text.

Section 7-204 of the Uniform Commercial Code sets forth the warehouser's 
standard of care, and allows for a limit on the amount of damages due to 
negligence for which he may be liable. This limitation should be expressed per 
article, per item, or per weight. WARES prints a **Liability Limit** statement 
on warehouse receipts. _[1] Either the statment shown here is printed, or the 
declared value of the customer account will be used.

Company Addresses
=============================

WARES uses between one and four contact address records for the warehouse 
company, based on the following specific type codes and the company identifier.

+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code  | Description                                                    |
+=======+================================================================+
| C     | The Company general mailing address                            |
+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| ST    | The Company package receiving address                          |
+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| BT    | The Company Bill To address, used for payables                 |
+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| RI    | The Company remittance address, printed on invoices            |
+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+

The type **C** address record for a warehouse is mandatory. Where another 
specific type of contact record is missing for the company, WARES will use the 
general type **C** address instead. 

.. tip::
   Addresses are maintained through Contacts entries. Refer to :ref:`contacts` 
   for further information.

Company Invoice Messages
=============================

Calculating billing and producing invoices are primary functions of the WARES 
software. Typically a warehousing company may produce several types of charges: 
accessorial services on receiving and shipping, handling and storage calculated 
on Warehouse Receipts, recurring storage, freight and transportation, and 
miscellaneous services.

WARES accumulates all types of charges to produce a standard summary invoice 
and associated audit reports of varying levels of detail. In addition, WARES 
will print Warehouse Receipts as individual invoices or as documents to attach 
to a master invoice. Warehouse Receipts may be printed prior to accumulation to 
an invoice, or after an invoice for the services has been generated.

Receipts which are issued prior to invoicing should have a printed message to 
tell the recipient that the receipt itself is not an invoice. Invoiced receipts 
should state that the charges are due upon receipt, since this enforces a 
warehouse lein against the goods.

**Document Messages** allow the company to specify the exact wording for each 
type of invoice message. Message types are provided for uninvoiced receipts,
invoiced receipts, and standard invoices.

Company Process Control
=============================

**Process Controls** set features which affect the global operation of WARES.
These entries include:

*  **Entry Status** -- Use this entry to set the default status applied to 
   current records during entry. The available statuses would be **2** 
   (allocated) or **3** (verified received/shipped), as listed in the 
   :ref:`status-list`.
*  **Period Start** -- This date begins the current open accounting period for 
   the warehouse. Transactions prior to this date are marked archived status.
*  **Next Period** -- This date begins a "future" period for billing 
   calculations. Transactions entered to this date and beyond should not be 
   invoiced until the current period is closed.
