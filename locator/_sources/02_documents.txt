master documents table. Source documents can be selected and reviewed by 
clicking the document number link on a locator item, or by using the locator 
**Documents** view page. 

.. note::
   #. The term **Document** refers to heading information for a group of 
      inventory transaction lines applied together.
   #. Each document has a unique type, listed at :ref:`codes:type-list`.

Documents Filter

date or date range, reference, shipping address id (and product, and lot).
