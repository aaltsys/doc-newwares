Product Setup Views
=============================

The product record masterfile entry consists of 5 sections described as 
follows.

.. note::
   In each section, a rule line separates basic entries (above the line) from
   advanced entries (below the rule). In the DIMENSIONS section, The INNER 
   column is also in the advanced area, and the entirety of LOCATOR CONTROLS and 
   NOTES AND MESSAGES are part of advanced entries.

.. sidebar:: Product Identification

   Required entries **Account** and **Product**, and optional **Variety**, 
   combine to form a unique identifier for each product. Other indexed entries 
   which link to the product identifier for categories and search are included 
   in this section: **Stock Number** alternatives, **Description** text, and a 
   **Hazard** flag.

   .. tip::
      When **Hazard** is checked, a **Proper Shipping Name** entry is required. 
      Checking **Hazard** when in basic entry will cause a warning message:
      *this feature is available only in advanced mode*.

.. sidebar:: Product Classification

   Entries classify products according to functions and features of WARES. 
   Three are primary classification entries are:
   
   *  **Tracking** defines whether a product is fungible, or uses lot control, 
      or is tracked by individual units. Fungible bulk products (unit UOM = BN)
      track inventory by location, non-fungible inventory is tracked by location 
      and lot.
   *  **Lot Control** specifies the type of information used for lot numbers.
   *  **Rate** identifies the rate calculations for warehouse services charges 
      of storage and handling.

.. sidebar:: Dimensions

   Dimension entries determine the uints of measure to display for goods, and 
   the counts and factors to extend or extrapolate from weights, sizes, and
   unit counts from the basic inventory content (or inner) quantities.

.. sidebar:: Location Control

   Advanced WARES settings allow warehouse location control with features for:
   
   *  Directed putaway and automated pick assignment 
   *  Re-warehousing calculation for space and travel optimization 
   *  Cycle counting and bulk inventory collection for inventory accuracy.
   
   These features are accessed through an Android-based application, available
   for free from the Google store for use with Advanced WARES.

Product Inventory View
=============================

.. image:: _images/inventory.png

Notes:

#. Quantities are synthesized from locator entries as follows:

   | ARRIVING  = ON-ORDER + IN-TRANSIT
   | ON-HAND = ALL WAREHOUSE CONTENT
   | ALL-HELD = SAFETY STOCK + INSPECTION HOLD + PROCESS HOLD + DAMAGED
   | ALLOCATED = SHIP-RESERVED + PICK-ALLOCATED
   | AVAILABLE = ON-HAND - ALL-HELD - ALLOCATED
   | Ship reserve may be placed against ARRIVING stock, so AVAILABLE can be negative.

#. Product entries link to the PRODUCT information, displayed in a lightbox. 
   Clicking (Double-clicking?) elsewhere on a line displays LOCATOR details for 
   that product unit.

Product Filters
=============================

.. image:: _images/inventory-filter.png

Notes:

#. Filter items "Building" and "Accout" accept single entries only and do 
   not display columns. When set by login, as with account connection, these 
   items are grayed out and not selectable.
#. PRODUCT and STOCK-NUMBER filters are multi-entry and use autocomplete.
#. Products without locator quantities cannot be entered in the filter or 
   displayed.
#. For a mobile interface, tuneable columns would not display by default.
