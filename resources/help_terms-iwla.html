in violation of this agreement, goods are shipped to warehouseman as named
consignee, depositor agrees to notify carrier in writing prior to such shipment,
with copy of such notice to the warehouseman, that warehouseman named as
consignee is a warehouseman and has no beneficial title or interest in such
property and depositor further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
warehouseman from any and all claims for unpaid transportation charges,
including undercharges, demurrage, detention or charges of any nature, in
connection with goods so shipped. Depositor further agrees that, if it fails to
notify carrier as required by the preceding sentence, warehouseman shall have

<li>Storage charges become applicable on the date that warehouseman accepts
care, custody and control of the goods, regardless of unloading date or
date of issue of warehouse receipt.</li>

charge will apply on all goods received between the first and the 15th,
inclusive, of a calendar month; one-half month&#8217;s storage charge will apply

<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Instructions to transfer goods on the books of the warehouseman are not
effective until delivered to and accepted by warehouseman, and all charges
up to the time transfer is made are chargeable to the depositor of record.
If a transfer involves rehandling the goods, such will be subject to a
charge. When goods in storage are transferred from one party to  another
through issuance of a new warehouse receipt, a new storage date is
established on the date of transfer.</li>
<li>The warehouseman reserves the right to move, at his expense, 14 days after
notice is sent by certified or registered mail to the depositor of record
or to the last known holder of the negotiable warehouse receipt, any goods
in storage from the warehouse in which they may be stored to any other of
his warehouses; but if such depositor or holder takes delivery of his goods
in lieu of transfer, no storage charge shall be made for the current
storage month. Warehouseman will store the goods at, and may without notice
move goods within and between, any one or more of the warehouse buildings
which comprise the warehouse complex identified on the front of this
warehouse receipt.</li>
<li>The warehouseman may, upon written notice to the depositor of record and
any other person known by the warehouseman to claim an interest in the
goods, require the removal of any goods by the end of the next succeeding
storage month. Such notice shall be given to the last known place of
business or abode of the person to be notified. If goods are not removed
before the end of the next succeeding storage month, the warehouseman may
sell them in accordance with applicable law.</li>
<li>If warehouseman in good faith believes that the goods are about to
deteriorate or decline in value to less than the amount of warehouseman&#8217;s
lien before the end of the next succeeding storage month, the warehouseman
may specify in the notification any reasonable shorter time for removal of
the goods and in case the goods are not removed, may sell them at public
sale held one week after a single advertisement or posting as provided by
law.</li>
<li>If as a result of a quality or condition of the goods of which the
warehouseman had no notice at the time of deposit the goods are a hazard to
other property or to the warehouse or to persons, the warehouseman may sell
the goods at public or private sale without advertisement on reasonable
notification to all persons known to claim an interest in the goods. If the
warehouseman after a reasonable effort is unable to sell the goods he may
dispose of them in any lawful manner and shall incur no liability by reason
of such disposition. Pending such disposition, sale or return of the goods,
the warehouseman may remove the goods from the warehouse and shall incur no
liability by reason of such removal.</li>

at warehouse door, placing goods in storage, and returning goods to
warehouse  door. Handling charges are due and payable on receipt of goods.</li>

warehouseman of complete written instructions. Written instructions shall
include, but are not limited to, FAX, EDI, TWX or similar communication,
provided warehouseman has no liability when relying on the information
contained in the communication as received. However, when no negotiable
receipt is outstanding, goods may be delivered upon instruction by
telephone in accordance with a prior written authorization, but the
warehouseman shall not be responsible for loss or error occasioned thereby.</li>
<li>When a negotiable receipt has been issued no goods covered by that receipt
shall be delivered, or transferred on the books of the warehouseman, unless
the receipt, properly endorsed, is surrendered for cancellation, or for
endorsement of partial delivery thereon. If a negotiable receipt is lost or
destroyed, delivery of goods may be made only upon order of a court of
competent jurisdiction and the posting of security approved by the court as
provided by law.</li>
<li>When goods are ordered out a reasonable time shall be given the
warehouseman to carry out instructions, and if he is unable because of acts
of God, war, public enemies, seizure under legal process, strikes,
lockouts, riots and civil commotions, or any reason beyond the
warehouseman&#8217;s control, or because of loss or destruction of goods for
which warehouseman is not liable, or because of any other excuse provided
by law, the warehouseman shall not be liable for failure to carry out such
instructions and goods remaining in storage will continue to be subject to
regular storage charges.</li>
