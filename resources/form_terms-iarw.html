and control of the GOODS, regardless of unloading date or date warehouse
receipt is issued. Unless COMPANY specifies otherwise, storage charges
shall be computed separately for each LOT on one of the following optional
bases:</li>
<li>If storage rates are quoted on a &#8220;SPLIT MONTH BASIS&#8221; the storage month

<h2>SECTION 7 &#8211; TRANSFER OF TITLE: DELIVERY<a class="headerlink" href="#section-7-transfer-of-title-delivery" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Instructions by STORER to transfer GOODS to the account of another are not
effective until delivered to and accepted by COMPANY. Charges will be made
for each such transfer and for any rehandling of GOODS deemed by COMPANY to
be required thereby. COMPANY reserves the right not to deliver or transfer
GOODS to or for the account of others except upon receipt of written
instructions properly signed by STORER.</li>
<li>STORER may furnish written instructions authorizing COMPANY to accept
telephone orders for delivery. In such case, (1) COMPANY may require that
each telephone order be confirmed by STORER in writing within 24 hours, and

STORER. COMPANY will not be liable for any loss resulting from delivery
made pursuant to telephone order, whether or not so authorized, unless
COMPANY failed to exercise reasonable care with respect thereto.</li>
<li>COMPANY shall have a reasonable time to make delivery after GOODS are
ordered out and shall have a minimum of 10 business days after receipt of a
delivery order in which to locate any misplaced GOODS.</li>

beyond its control, to effect delivery before expiration of the current
storage period, the GOODS may, at COMPANY&#8217;s discretion, be subject to
storage charges for each succeeding storage period.</li>

are received subject to satisfaction of all charges, liens and security
interests of COMPANY with respect to the GOODS whether for accrued charges
or ADVANCES or otherwise.</li>
<li>COMPANY may require, as a condition precedent to delivery, a statement from
STORER holding COMPANY harmless from claims of others asserting a superior
right to STORER to possession of the GOODS. Nothing herein shall preclude
COMPANY from exercising any other remedy available to it under the law to
resolve conflicting claims to possession of the GOODS. All costs, including
attorney&#8217;s fees, incurred by COMPANY relating in any way to COMPANY&#8217;s
activities referred to in SECTION 7 (f) shall be charged to STORER and
shall, for purposes of SECTION 12 below, be considered &#8220;charges present or
future with respect to such GOODS&#8221; and shall attach as a lien on the GOODS.</li>

<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>COMPANY shall not be liable for any loss, damage or destruction to GOODS,
however caused, unless such loss, damage or destruction resulted from the

SUCH INCREASED VALUATION; FURTHER PROVIDED THAT NO SUCH REQUEST SHALL BE
VALID UNLESS MADE BEFORE LOSS, DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION TO ANY PORTION OF THE
GOODS HAS OCCURRED.</li>
<li>The COMPANY&#8217;s liability referred to in section 9(d) shall be STORER&#8217;S
exclusive remedy against COMPANY for any claim or cause of action
whatsoever relating to loss, damage and/or destruction of GOODS and shall
apply to all claims including inventory shortage and mysterious
disappearance claims unless STORER proves by affirmative evidence that
COMPANY converted the GOODS to its own use. STORER waives any rights to

STORER be entitled to incidental, special, punitive, or consequential
damages.</li>

shall provide COMPANY with a reasonable opportunity to inspect the GOODS
which are the basis of STORER&#8217;S claim.</li>
