=============================

(a) This contract and rate quotation including accessorial charges endorsed on
    or attached hereto must be accepted within 30 days from the proposal date 
    by signature of depositor on the reverse side of the contract. In the 
    absence of written acceptance, the act of tendering goods described herein 
    for storage or other services by warehouseman within 30 days from the 
    proposal date shall constitute such acceptance by depositor.
(b) In the event that goods tendered for storage or other services do not 
    conform to the description contained herein, or conforming goods are 
    tendered after 30 days from the proposal date without prior written 
    acceptance by depositor as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, 
    warehouseman may refuse to accept such goods. If warehouseman accepts 
    such goods, depositor agrees to rates and charges as may be assigned and 
    invoiced by warehouseman and to all terms of this contract.
(c) This contract may be canceled by either party upon 30 days written notice 
    and is canceled if no storage or other services are performed under this 
    contract for a period of 180 days.

Sec. 2 -- SHIPPING
=============================

Depositor agrees not to ship goods to warehouseman as the named consignee. If, 
in violation of this agreement, goods are shipped to warehouseman as named 
consignee, depositor agrees to notify carrier in writing prior to such shipment, 
with copy of such notice to the warehouseman, that warehouseman named as 
consignee is a warehouseman and has no beneficial title or interest in such 
property and depositor further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless 
warehouseman from any and all claims for unpaid transportation charges, 
including undercharges, demurrage, detention or charges of any nature, in 
connection with goods so shipped. Depositor further agrees that, if it fails to 
notify carrier as required by the preceding sentence, warehouseman shall have 
the right to refuse such goods and shall not be liable or responsible for any 
loss, injury or damage of any nature to, or related to, such goods.

Sec. 3 -- TENDER FOR STORAGE 
=============================

All goods for storage shall be delivered at the warehouse properly marked and 
packaged for handling. The depositor shall furnish at or prior to such delivery, 
a manifest showing marks, brands, or sizes to be kept and accounted for 
separately, and the class of storage and other services desired.

Sec. 4 -- STORAGE PERIOD AND CHARGES 
=====================================

(a) All charges for storage are per package or other agreed unit per month.
(b) Storage charges become applicable on the date that warehouseman accepts 
    care, custody and control of the goods, regardless of unloading date or 
    date of issue of warehouse receipt.
(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, a full month's storage 
    charge will apply on all goods received between the first and the 15th, 
    inclusive, of a calendar month; one-half month's storage charge will apply 
    on all goods received between the 16th and last day, inclusive, of a 
    calendar month, and a full month's storage charge will apply to all goods 
    in storage on the first day of the next and succeeding calendar months. All 
    storage charges are due and payable on the first day of storage for the 
    initial month and thereafter on the first day of the calendar month.
(d) When mutually agreed by the warehouseman and the depositor, a storage month 
    shall extend from a date in one calendar month to, but not including, the 
    same date of the next and all succeeding months. All storage charges are 
    due and payable on the first day of the storage month.

Sec. 5 -- TRANSFER, TERMINATION OF STORAGE, REMOVAL OF GOODS 
==============================================================

(a) Instructions to transfer goods on the books of the warehouseman are not 
    effective until delivered to and accepted by warehouseman, and all charges 
    up to the time transfer is made are chargeable to the depositor of record. 
    If a transfer involves rehandling the goods, such will be subject to a 
    charge. When goods in storage are transferred from one party to another 
    through issuance of a new warehouse receipt, a new storage date is 
    established on the date of transfer.
(b) The warehouseman reserves the right to move, at his expense, 14 days after 
    notice is sent by certified or registered mail to the depositor of record 
    or to the last known holder of the negotiable warehouse receipt, any goods 
    in storage from the warehouse in which they may be stored to any other of 
    his warehouses; but if such depositor or holder takes delivery of his goods 
    in lieu of transfer, no storage charge shall be made for the current 
    storage month. Warehouseman will store the goods at, and may without notice 
    move goods within and between, any one or more of the warehouse buildings 
    which comprise the warehouse complex identified on the front of this 
    warehouse receipt.
(c) The warehouseman may, upon written notice to the depositor of record and 
    any other person known by the warehouseman to claim an interest in the 
    goods, require the removal of any goods by the end of the next succeeding 
    storage month. Such notice shall be given to the last known place of 
    business or abode of the person to be notified. If goods are not removed 
    before the end of the next succeeding storage month, the warehouseman may 
    sell them in accordance with applicable law.
(d) If warehouseman in good faith believes that the goods are about to 
    deteriorate or decline in value to less than the amount of warehouseman's 
    lien before the end of the next succeeding storage month, the warehouseman 
    may specify in the notification any reasonable shorter time for removal of 
    the goods and in case the goods are not removed, may sell them at public 
    sale held one week after a single advertisement or posting as provided by 
    law.
(e) If as a result of a quality or condition of the goods of which the 
    warehouseman had no notice at the time of deposit the goods are a hazard to 
    other property or to the warehouse or to persons, the warehouseman may sell 
    the goods at public or private sale without advertisement on reasonable 
    notification to all persons known to claim an interest in the goods. If the
    warehouseman after a reasonable effort is unable to sell the goods he may 
    dispose of them in any lawful manner and shall incur no liability by reason 
    of such disposition. Pending such disposition, sale or return of the goods, 
    the warehouseman may remove the goods from the warehouse and shall incur no 
    liability by reason of such removal.

Sec. 6 -- HANDLING 
=============================

(a) The handling charge covers the ordinary labor involved in receiving goods 
    at warehouse door, placing goods in storage, and returning goods to 
    warehouse  door. Handling charges are due and payable on receipt of goods.
(b) Unless otherwise agreed, labor for unloading and loading goods will be 
    subject to a charge. Additional expenses incurred by the warehouseman in 
    receiving and handling damaged goods, and additional expense in unloading 
    from or loading into cars or other vehicles not at warehouse door will be 
    charged to the depositor.
(c) Labor and materials used in loading rail cars or other vehicles are 
    chargeable to the depositor.
(d) When goods are ordered out in quantities less than in which received, the 
    warehouseman may make an additional charge for each order or each item of 
    an order.
(e) The warehouseman shall not be liable for demurrage or detention, delays in 
    unloading inbound cars, trailers or other containers, or delays in 
    obtaining and loading cars, trailers or other containers for outbound 
    shipment unless warehouseman has failed to exercise reasonable care.

Sec. 7 -- DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS 
================================

(a) No goods shall be delivered or transferred except upon receipt by the 
    warehouseman of complete written instructions. Written instructions shall 
    include, but are not limited to, FAX, EDI, TWX or similar communication, 
    provided warehouseman has no liability when relying on the information 
    contained in the communication as received. However, when no negotiable 
    receipt is outstanding, goods may be delivered upon instruction by 
    telephone in accordance with a prior written authorization, but the 
    warehouseman shall not be responsible for loss or error occasioned thereby.
(b) When a negotiable receipt has been issued no goods covered by that receipt 
    shall be delivered, or transferred on the books of the warehouseman, unless 
    the receipt, properly endorsed, is surrendered for cancellation, or for 
    endorsement of partial delivery thereon. If a negotiable receipt is lost or 
    destroyed, delivery of goods may be made only upon order of a court of
    competent jurisdiction and the posting of security approved by the court as 
    provided by law.
(c) When goods are ordered out a reasonable time shall be given the 
    warehouseman to carry out instructions, and if he is unable because of acts 
    of God, war, public enemies, seizure under legal process, strikes, 
    lockouts, riots and civil commotions, or any reason beyond the 
    warehouseman's control, or because of loss or destruction of goods for 
    which warehouseman is not liable, or because of any other excuse provided 
    by law, the warehouseman shall not be liable for failure to carry out such 
    instructions and goods remaining in storage will continue to be subject to 
    regular storage charges.

Sec. 8 -- EXTRA SERVICES (SPECIAL SERVICES) 
============================================

(a) Warehouse labor required for services other than ordinary handling and 
    storage will be charged to the depositor.

    transit billing will be subject to a charge.
(c) Dunnage, bracing, packing materials or other special supplies, may be 
    provided for the depositor at a charge in addition to the warehouseman's 
    cost.
(d) By prior arrangement, goods may be received or delivered during other than 
    usual business hours, subject to a charge.
