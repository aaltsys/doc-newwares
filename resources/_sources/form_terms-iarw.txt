    of the GOODS, or any portion thereof, from the warehouse upon the payment

    charges related to said removal shall be paid by STORER.

SECTION 4 -- STORAGE LOCATION
=============================

(a) The GOODS shall be stored at COMPANY'S discretion at any one or more 
    buildings at COMPANY'S warehouse complex identified on the front side of 
    this Warehouse Receipt. The identification of any specific location within

    stored therein.

    gross weight and 2,000 pounds shall constitute a ton.

SECTION 6 -- HANDLING CHARGES
=============================

    only the ordinary labor and duties incidental to receiving and delivering 
    unitized GOODS on pallets at the warehouse dock during normal warehouse 
    hours but do not include loading and unloading.
(b) Unless otherwise specified, a charge in addition to the regular handling 
    charges will be made for any work performed by COMPANY other than specified 
    in Section (a) at rates which are in effect from time to time, a copy of

    all the fungible GOODS stored for STORER shall be made without subsequent 
    sorting except by special arrangement which may be subject to an additional 
    charge.

SECTION 7 -- TRANSFER OF TITLE: DELIVERY
=========================================

(a) Instructions by STORER to transfer GOODS to the account of another are not 
    effective until delivered to and accepted by COMPANY. Charges will be made 
    for each such transfer and for any rehandling of GOODS deemed by COMPANY to 
    be required thereby. COMPANY reserves the right not to deliver or transfer 
    GOODS to or for the account of others except upon receipt of written 
    instructions properly signed by STORER.
(b) STORER may furnish written instructions authorizing COMPANY to accept 
    telephone orders for delivery. In such case, (1) COMPANY may require that 
    each telephone order be confirmed by STORER in writing within 24 hours, and 
    (2) acceptance by COMPANY of any telephone order shall be at the risk of 
    STORER. COMPANY will not be liable for any loss resulting from delivery 
    made pursuant to telephone order, whether or not so authorized, unless 
    COMPANY failed to exercise reasonable care with respect thereto.
(c) COMPANY shall have a reasonable time to make delivery after GOODS are 
    ordered out and shall have a minimum of 10 business days after receipt of a 
    delivery order in which to locate any misplaced GOODS.
(d) If COMPANY has exercised reasonable care and is unable, due to causes 
    beyond its control, to effect delivery before expiration of the current 
    storage period, the GOODS may, at COMPANY's discretion, be subject to 
    storage charges for each succeeding storage period.
(e) All instructions and requests for delivery of GOODS or transfer of title 
    are received subject to satisfaction of all charges, liens and security 
    interests of COMPANY with respect to the GOODS whether for accrued charges 
    or ADVANCES or otherwise.
(f) COMPANY may require, as a condition precedent to delivery, a statement from 
    STORER holding COMPANY harmless from claims of others asserting a superior 
    right to STORER to possession of the GOODS. Nothing herein shall preclude 
    COMPANY from exercising any other remedy available to it under the law to 
    resolve conflicting claims to possession of the GOODS. All costs, including
    attorney's fees, incurred by COMPANY relating in any way to COMPANY's 
    activities referred to in SECTION 7 (f) shall be charged to STORER and 
    shall, for purposes of SECTION 12 below, be considered "charges present or 
    future with respect to such GOODS" and shall attach as a lien on the GOODS.

    chargeable to STORER.
(d) In the event of damage or threatened damage to stored GOODS, STORER shall 
    pay all reasonable and necessary costs of protecting and preserving the

    all affected STORERS on a pro rata basis to be determined by the COMPANY.
(e) COMPANY shall supply dunnage bracing and fastenings where it deems it 
    appropriate on outbound shipments and the cost thereof is chargeable to

(f) Any additional costs incurred by COMPANY in unloading cars or trucks 
    containing damaged GOODS are chargeable to STORER.

    Bankruptcy proceedings) involving in any way said GOODS and/or STORER's 
    performance under this agreement. All such costs, ADVANCES, and fees, for 
    purposes of SECTION 12 below, shall constitute "charges present or future
    with respect to such goods".

SECTION 9 -- LIABILITY AND LIMITATION OF DAMAGES
=================================================

(a) COMPANY shall not be liable for any loss, damage or destruction to GOODS, 
    however caused, unless such loss, damage or destruction resulted from the 
    COMPANY'S failure to exercise such care in regard to the GOODS as a 
    reasonably careful man would exercise under like circumstances. COMPANY is 
    not liable for damages which could not have been avoided by the exercise of 
    such care.

    ALL OF THE GOODS IN WHICH CASE AN INCREASED CHARGE WILL BE MADE BASED UPON

    VALID UNLESS MADE BEFORE LOSS, DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION TO ANY PORTION OF THE 
    GOODS HAS OCCURRED.
(e) The COMPANY's liability referred to in section 9(d) shall be STORER'S 
    exclusive remedy against COMPANY for any claim or cause of action 
    whatsoever relating to loss, damage and/or destruction of GOODS and shall 
    apply to all claims including inventory shortage and mysterious 
    disappearance claims unless STORER proves by affirmative evidence that 
    COMPANY converted the GOODS to its own use. STORER waives any rights to

    PROVIDED WAREHOUSEMAN WITH A REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY TO INSPECT THE GOODS AS
