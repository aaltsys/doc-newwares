<div class="section" id="rate-overview">
<h2>Rate Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#rate-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Rate records define charges for the warehouse services which are invoiced to
customers. A charge cannot be applied to a document, transaction, or action
without a rate record defining the charge.</p>
<p>WARES rate definitions allow a company to bill all types of services according
to standard industry practices. When writing a proposal or contract, rates
should be entered here to verify that the proposal is consistent with industry
norms and can be implemented as intended within the WARES software.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scope-of-rates">
<h2>Scope of Rates<a class="headerlink" href="#scope-of-rates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Warehouse services are defined by the warehouse company service codes. Each
rate relates to eactly one service code.</p>
<p>A rate group determines the scope of a rate.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Rates in the <strong>GLOBAL</strong> group apply across all accounts, and the account
entry for GLOBAL rates is null and protected. There can be no more than one
global rate for any service.</li>
<li>Rates gouped by <strong>account</strong> identifier apply to only one warehouse customer
account, and the account entry of these rates is filled with the account
identifier and protected. There can be no more than one account rate for any
service.</li>
<li>Rates may be assigned a group code different than an account identifier or
GLOBAL. The account entry must be the same for all rates in the group. If
the account entry is left blank on a rate group, those rates can be applied
to any account. If the account entry is filled, the rates will be restricted
to that account.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many rate records may refer to the same service code, and an account may have
more than one rate for a service, provided the rates are in differing groups.
For example, there should be different recurring storage rates for cartons on
pallets stacked 3 high than for supersacks stacked 2 high. This would require
two separate rate groups associated with the account.</p>
<p>Rate records may be associated with a single account, or may be applied globally
to all accounts. There can be no more than one GLOBAL rate for any service.
Where an account or group has a specific rate for a service, the group&#8217;s rate
will override a corresponding GLOBAL rate with the same service code.</p>
<p>Rates may be restricted to apply on specific documents. For example, receiving
storage would apply to warehouse receipts only.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="applying-rates">
<h2>Applying Rates<a class="headerlink" href="#applying-rates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A rate is used to apply charges in one of four ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Repeating</strong> rates may create separate charge entries according to a
calendar schedule. Repeating charges have fixed rates and quantities, so
the charge is always the same.
Calendar selections for repeating charges are for daily or daily within the
open billing month, weekdays on specific days, monthdays on specific
numbered days or on LAST or FIRST days, and year days (Julian) or year dates.</li>
<li><strong>Calculated</strong> rates apply warehouse storage and handling charges to products
on warehouse receipts and optionally shipments (for outbound handling), and
to calculate charges for recurring product balances.</li>
<li><strong>Mandatory</strong> rates may create charges on any documents, with calculation
quantities based on a broad range of options. For example, a document fee
could be applied for every shipment, while a line pick fee might be applied
for every line item after the third one.</li>
<li><strong>Optional</strong> rates are used to apply charges where either the occurrence, the
quantity, or the rate cannot be determined programmatically. As an example,
a charge for replacing a pallet shell and restacking goods would be optional,
as this activity cannot be anticipated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only optional rates can be used in entering charges, as all other rates are
applied by billing calculation. Optional charges must be entered on documents
prior to performing calculated billing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setting-up-rates">
<h2>Setting Up Rates<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-rates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Rate Setup page is divided into three sections: Identifying Information,
Billing Information, and Calendar Information.</p>
<img alt="_images/account-rates1.png" src="_images/account-rates1.png" />
<div class="section" id="identifying-entries">
<h3>Identifying entries:<a class="headerlink" href="#identifying-entries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>Rate identifiers are made of two parts: a <strong>Rate Group</strong> and a <strong>Service Code</strong>.
The <strong>Rate Group</strong> entry can be either the word GLOBAL, an account identifier,
or a user-defined rate group.</p>
<p><strong>Service Code</strong> may be selected from the warehouse service codes list.</p>
<p>The <strong>Account</strong> entry will be filled for rate records which are in an account
group, and it will be null for GLOBAL rates.</p>
<p>A rate may <strong>Apply</strong> in one of four ways: Optional, Mandatory, Calculated, or
Repeating. The service code determines which rates are Calculated or Repeating,
and the <strong>Apply</strong> code is filled and protected accordingly. Use the options to
select Optional or Mandatory for other service codes. Optional rates are
applied through user entry, while charges for mandatory rates are created by
billing calculations. Calculated rates are applied through special routines.
Finally, Repeating rates create charge records and accumulate charges based on
the repeating rate&#8217;s schedule.</p>

<h3>Billing Information<a class="headerlink" href="#billing-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>ENTERING TARIFFS:</p>
<p>Tariffs may be modified or added at any time.  A tariff should not be edited or
deleted when open transactions exist with the charge applied to them.  Please
refer to CONSIDERATIONS WHEN ENTERING TARIFFS before entering tariffs for the
first time.</p>
<p>The Surcharge field is used to enter surcharge information for high value goods
or a tax rate.  Enter a percentage, not a decimal value.</p>
<p>The Factor field converts between program quantities and billing quantities.
The default value is 1.00 and this is the usual entry.  However, certain
quantities require other entries.  If a product is received by the pound and
billed by the hundredweight, then the Factor in 100.  If it is billed by ton,
then the factor is 2,000.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Select a Billing UOM (unit of measure) from the drop down box or enter the code.</dt>
<dd>This information appears on the invoice.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Ledger Code field fills in automatically based on the tariff code setup.</p>
<p>The Description field is user-defined and should be meaningful to the customer
receiving the invoice.  Press [Ctrl+T] to use the zoom text feature.</p>
<p>Next, enter the Rate to be charged for this tariff.  Where a rate for a
particular charge is variable, the Rate field may be left blank and entered
manually each time the charge is applied; or enter the most commonly found rate
and override the default when applied.  If this is a tiered rate, enter a
Quantity amount for this rate.  Enter the Minimum charge per line item here.
When a charge may apply to multiple items on a transaction, and an overall
minimum for the charge on the transaction is required, enter this minimum in the
Transaction/Item Minimum field.</p>
<p>The Table Name column defines which type of transaction the charge can be
applied to.  To allow the charge to be applied to ALL transactions, leave this
field blank.</p>
<p>The Per Code determines how the charge is extended.  For example a Per
Transaction charge will be extended once when applied, whereas a Per Piece will
be multiplied by the number of pieces on the affected transaction.  When the
Table name is left blank, The Per unit must be blank also.</p>
<p>The Quantity Column contains dictionary element names which may be real data
fields or symbolic dictionary names.  The application automatically fills in the
default as defined on Per Code control window.  The user may make other entries
as well.</p>
<p>When someone other than the Account is to receive the invoice for these charges,
enter the Payer Key or a dictionary element which will return the key.  The
Payer Column is usually blank, in which case the Account for this tariff
receives the invoice.</p>
<p>CALENDAR INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Repeating tariffs may be applied by Every Day, Week Days, Month Days, Year Days,
and Year Dates.  Select the appropriate radio button for this tariff.  Next,
enter the desired Values for this schedule.  Enter a Last Date value to specify
when the tariff will start to be applied, and enter an Expire Date if the tariff
should be discontinued.  Next Date is calculated by the system based on the
other entries.</p>
<p>CONSIDERATIONS WHEN ENTERING TARIFFS:</p>
<p>Before any tariffs are entered, one must decide what services are being offered
and what the default, or retail, rates are for those services.  When defining a
list of services, do not over-generalize.  For example, do not lump all labor
services into a single heading, when they can be broken down into specific
activities such as RESTACKING, PACKAGING, RELOCATING, and so forth.</p>
<p>Global Tariffs: Once your business services are identified, enter a global
tariff for each optional service using the highest rate charged.  These tariff
records should be grouped under one tariff name, for example, tariff &#8220;GLOBAL&#8221;.
Leave the Account blank on these records, and set Apply to &#8220;Optional&#8221;.  These
Tariffs may be applied by hand on any account.</p>
<p>Override Tariffs: For negotiated rates on each account, use the account
identifier as the Tariff Key and enter the same code as the global service code
for that service.  Enter the Account identifier in the Account field as well.
This causes the negotiated tariff to override the global rates for a service.</p>
<p>Mandatory Tariffs: Where a transaction should always generate a charge, enter a
tariff for the service with Apply set to &#8220;Mandatory&#8221;.  Then a charge will be
added to each specified transaction on the tariffed account.  Generally
Mandatory tariffs should be assigned to specific accounts.  Mandatory tariffs
are applied during Charges Calculation, or when changing a record&#8217;s status to
billed.</p>
<p>Repeating Tariffs: When a charge is not based on a transaction, but is applied
periodically instead, the tariff for the charge should be made repeating.
Charge records for repeating tariffs are created during Charges Calculation,
when either &#8220;Only&#8221; or &#8220;Also&#8221;&#8221; is entered for &#8220;Apply Repeating Charges&#8221;.
Repeating tariffs are applied based on the tariff schedule.</p>
<p>An example of a repeating tariff would be a lease charge.  This charge might be
created on the first day of the month for the current month (current), on the
last day of the month for the future month (advance), or on the last day of the
month for the current month (arrears).  The schedule would be based on
&#8220;MONTHDAYS&#8221;, using the date value of &#8220;FIRST&#8221; for current billing and &#8220;LAST&#8221; for
either advance or arrears billing.</p>
<p>Calculated Tariffs: Frequently charges are calculated based on discounts,
prorating, and other considerations.  Rates for these tariffs are defined in the
tariffs window, but special input parameters and billing calculations may be
necessary to calculate these charges.  When charges are calculated by special
routines, the corresponding tariffs must be applied as &#8220;Calculated&#8221;.  An example
of calculated tariffs is the storage and handling charges in a warehousing
module.</p>
<p>Multiple Tariffs: Typically optional and mandatory tariff codes are assigned by
account, while calculated tariffs are often assigned based on a grouping within
an account.  A particular calculated tariff name may require multiple codes in
an account.</p>
<p>For example, a warehouse may charge customers three different storage rates
depending on whether the goods are stored dry, cooled, or frozen.  Then each
account might have three storage tariffs.  For account &#8220;ABC&#8221;, these three
tariffs would each using code &#8220;1S&#8221; for storage.  The tariff codes might be
&#8220;D-ABC&#8221;, &#8220;C-ABC&#8221;, and &#8220;F-ABC&#8221; for dry, cooled and frozen respectively.  Each of
ABC&#8217;s products would be assigned to one of the three tariffs based on the type
of storage required.</p>
<p>Sharing Tariffs: Where tariffs are assigned to groupings rather than accounts,
they may be shared by multiple accounts.  For example, a warehouse may have one
standard rate for storing sacks of coffee beans.  By entering tariff &#8220;SACK&#8221;
without an account, this tariff could be used on coffee sack products for any
account.</p>
<p>CODE TABLE MAINTENANCE:</p>
<p>Codes may be edited or added to the list by pressing [Ctrl+G] while in the Code
field or select Manage/Design/Code Lists from the menu.</p>
<p>TARIFFS AND INVOICES:</p>
<p>===
Enter the Tariff group identifier, or lookup with:</p>
<p>text$   Where &#8220;text&#8221; is part of a word from the account name,
[Ctrl+D]        To select a tariff from an index value list, or
[Ctrl+Q]        To select tariff records using the Query window.</p>
<p>Tariff records may be retrieved by the account name. Enter part of a word from
the name to start an index search. For example, enter &#8220;PAPER$&#8221; to select a
record from a popup list of tariffs for account &#8220;Paper The Walls&#8221;.</p>
<p>Press [Ctrl+D] to see an index value list. Select a tariff group identifier
from this list to recall a tariff or to add a rate to an existing tariff.</p>
<p>Each unique service charge which may be applied requires a separate tariff rate
record. These records are identified by the combination of a tariff group
identifier and a rate code.
&#8212;
Enter a Tariff service code, or press</p>
<p>[Ctrl+D]        to select a code from an options list.</p>
<p>Enter a rate or tariff identifier code. Each defined rate in a tariff is
associated with a code.  Each unique service charge which may be applied
requires a separate tariff rate record. These records are identified by the
combination of a tariff group identifier and a rate code.</p>
<p>The list of available tariff codes is maintained in a codes table.  Press
[Ctrl+G] to edit the Tariff codes setup.</p>
