<p>The warehouse assigns an identifier to each account, and associated with this
identifier is a literal account name.</p>
<p>Using the <a class="reference internal" href="07_contacts.html#contacts"><em>Contacts and Addresses</em></a> form, between one and four addresses may be entered
for an account identifier. A type code determines how each address is used in
the program. The four type codes are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>A</strong> &#8211; The primary account mailing address for inventory reporting and
correspondence. This address is required for every account, as it appears on
Bill of Lading and Warehouse Receipt forms.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>ST</strong> &#8211; An optional package shipment address is recorded in case the
account&#8217;s mailing address is a P.O. box.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>BT</strong> &#8211; Invoices may require a separate mailing address, even if it just
means using a different contact line such as <em>ATTN: ACCOUNTS PAYABLE</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>PF</strong> &#8211; All Prepaid Bills of Lading for an account will print the
account&#8217;s <strong>PF</strong> address in the <strong>Send Freight BIll To</strong> area, if it exists.
Otherwise the account&#8217;s Bill To (<strong>BT</strong>) or mailing (<strong>A</strong>) address will be
printed. (See Freight Payment, below.)</p>
<div class="admonition note">

<p class="last">Corporations often use an auditing service to review freight invoices,
which requires the separate address. Occasionally personnel may refer to
this service by the misnomer &#8220;Third Party Prepaid,&#8221; maybe because
&#8220;Third Party&#8221; is how their own software works to apply a separate freight
billing address.</p>

<p>A common clerical error in warehousing is to double-ship a customer&#8217;s order.
This error can occur either when a customer sends a set of orders twice, or
when the warehouse enters the orders twice. Neither of these situations may
be avoidable, so the solution to this problem must lie elsewhere.</p>
<p>WARES helps avoid this costly mistake by checking for duplication of the
combination of account, consignee, and reference numbers when saving a
document. Suspected duplicate documents are pended, and an error message issues
to alert the user.</p>
<p><strong>Find Duplicates</strong> &#8211; allows duplicate detection to be configured according to
each customer&#8217;s requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Freight Payment</strong> &#8211; These terms apply to Bill of Lading documents produced for
outbound shipments. There are three general categories of freight payment terms:
Prepaid (paid by the shipping Account), Collect (paid by the consignee shipper),
and Third Party (Paid by a broker or other party).</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong> &#8211; Messages and standing instructions to the warehouse or to a carrier
can be entered here to apply on documents for the account.</p>

<p>WARES calculates and invoices warehousing service charges based on receiving
and shipping activity, as well as recurring storage charges for space usage.
The Account Billing section defines the billing process for a customer using
the following entries:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Terms</strong> &#8211; print on an invoice to establish payment terms. Within WARES,
payment terms are considered descriptive and aging is performed by invoice
date.</li>
<li><strong>Invoicing Cycle</strong> &#8211; can determine the frequency of activity invoicing on
an account: Daily, Weekly, Semi-monthly, Monthly, or On Demand. (Generally
recurring storage is invoiced separately from activity, and it is controlled
separately.)</li>
<li><strong>PO Number</strong> &#8211; A customer may specify a PO Number to appear on invoices,
and otherwise they may not get paid. Enter the PO Number here.</li>
<li><strong>Minimum Storage Invoice</strong> &#8211; To discourage unprofitable customer
relationships, the warehouse may impose a minimum monthly fee for recurring
storage services.</li>
<li><strong>Percent Handling Income Deferred</strong> &#8211; Based on an account&#8217;s handling rates
and the amount of goods in storage at the end of a month, a deferred income
report will determine the warehouse liability for handling
services which have been invoiced, but which are yet to be performed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Third-party warehouses bill for the storage space an account uses. Customarily
a warehouse calculates the number of units of inventory in the warehouse at the
start of each month, and bills in advance for recurring storage. Similarly the
warehouse bills an additional storage charge for each unit of inventory received
during a month.</p>
<p>This section codifies the contractual terms for calculating storage charges on
an account, as described by the following items.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Receiving Storage</strong> &#8211; The receiving storage charge may be determined by
one of three methods: <strong>(F)ull month</strong> applies a full charge regardless of
day of receipt; <strong>(S)plit month</strong> applies a full charge for receiving on
month days 1 through 15, and half that charge for receiving on days 16
through the end of the month; <strong>(P)rorated</strong> multiplies the storage charge
by the ratio of the days remaining in the month to the number of days in the
month.</li>
<li><strong>Recurring Type</strong> &#8211; Sets the method of recurring calculation method as one
of the following options:
<strong>(E)nding balance</strong> for advance billing of calendar month storage,
<strong>(S)tarting balance</strong> for arrears billing of the previous month, and
<strong>(A)nniversary</strong> for calculating the recurring storage on each lot according
to the balance on succeeding month-days following receipt. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id2">[1]</a></li>
<li><strong>Free Days</strong> grants a customer a number of days before receiving and
recurring storage charges will be applied to received goods, while</li>
<li><strong>Grace Days</strong> waives receiving storage for goods within the grace period at
the end of a month.</li>
<li><strong>Declared Value</strong>, <strong>Per</strong>, and <strong>Surcharge</strong> specify a limitation to the
liability a warehouser has for an account&#8217;s goods, and expresses the storage
rate increase when the declared value of goods exceeds that limitation. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id3">[2]</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The warehouse may wish to restrict access to customer billing information.
Clerical personnel with restricted access should see only the basic account
information, as shown in the sidebar.</p>

<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id2">[1]</a></td><td><p class="first">Anniversary recurring calculation is commonly used in cold storage
warehouses which handle brokered goods. However, the results for this
calculation method are problematic for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>Anniversary recurring charges are disputable, as a customer may show
after the fact that manipulating shipping dates between lots could
reduce total storage charges. The Uniform Commercial Code states that
where a charge may be disputed, the presumption of the dispute favors
the customer.</li>
<li>Brokering involves ownership transfers which should be performed on
the date of a sale. Transferring a lot prior to its anniversary causes
a loss of paid storage for the transferee. To accomodate customers and
avoid disputes, a warehouse may follow problematic transfer procedures
which compromise inventory ownership accuracy, all the while losing
storage revenue for the warehouse.</li>
<li>Anniversary recurring is error-prone, complex, and unnecessary. As an
alternative, use the <strong>Prorated</strong> receiving option in WARES to
calculate an initial storage charge which shifts anniversaries to the
beginning of the next calendar month. Then use recurring type <strong>E</strong> to
calculate and bill recurring storage in advance. (Brokers may object,
but that should not be the warehouser&#8217;s problem.)</li>

standard of care, and permits the warehouser to set a limit on the amount
of damages for which he will be responsible. This limit must be expressed
per article, per item, or per weight; and the account must be allowed to
declare a higher limit (for which he may pay a correspondingly higher
charge).</p>
<p class="last">The limitation of damages is not a legally required element of a receipt,
but it must be stated on the receipt for the warehouser to claim this
protection. This limitation is expressed in large print on the warehouse
receipt because of its importance to the warehouse. The limitation from
the Warehouse Company Information will print on the warehouse receipt
unless a different declared value limit is entered on the account or on
specific product information records.</p>
