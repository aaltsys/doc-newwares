<div class="section" id="rate-overview">
<h2>Rate Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#rate-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Rate records define charges for the warehouse services which are invoiced to
customers. A charge cannot be applied to an activity, a transaction, or a bill
without a rate record defining the charge.</p>
<p>WARES rate definitions allow a company to bill all types of services according
to standard industry practices. When writing a proposal or contract, enter
proposed rates here to verify that the quote will be consistent with industry
norms and can be implemented as intended within the WARES software.</p>
<p>Warehouse services are defined by the company <a class="reference internal" href="04_services.html#services"><em>Warehousing Service Codes</em></a>. Each rate relates
to eactly one service code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scope-and-grouping-of-rates">
<h2>Scope and Grouping of Rates<a class="headerlink" href="#scope-and-grouping-of-rates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Rates are grouped and the type of group affects the scope of a rate. Any one
service code can appear only once in a group. All rates in a group will have
the same account entry. If the account entry is left blank on a rate group,
those rates can be applied to any account. If the account entry is filled, the
rates will be restricted to the specified account.</p>
<p>Many rate records may refer to the same service code, and an account may have
more than one rate for a service, provided the rates are in separate groups.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Rates in the <strong>GLOBAL</strong> group apply across all accounts, and the account
entry for GLOBAL rates is null and protected. The GLOBAL group sets default
rates for the company.</li>
<li>Rates gouped by <strong>account</strong> identifier apply to only one customer account,
and the account entry of these rates is filled with the account identifier
and protected.</li>
<li>Rates may be assigned a <strong>group</strong> code other than an account identifier or
GLOBAL. The account entry, which may be null, must be the same for all rates
in the group.</li>
</ul>
<p>A group rate for a service will override a corresponding GLOBAL rate with the
same service code, and account-associated rates and groups will override rates
which are not assigned to accounts.</p>
<p>Grouped rates are particularly inportant for calculated charges, specifically
storage and handling. As an example, there should be different storage rates
for cartons on pallets stacked 3 high than for supersacks stacked 2 high. This
would require two separate rate groups associated with the account. Typically
each rate group would include the calculated storage and handling service codes
for a group of products which are billed the same.</p>
<p>Another warehouse stores imported Boxed Boneless Beef. These goods are brokered
or traded while in the warehouse, so product is transferred between accounts.
The warehouse creates group <strong>BBB</strong> for the calculated rates on this product,
leaving the account identifier blank for the group. Every owner of the product
shares the same calculated storage and handling rates.</p>
<p>The scope of a rate may be restricted to specific activities. For example,
receiving handling rates should be applied to warehouse receipts only, copying
and long-distance FAXing fees might apply to receiving and shipping, and extra
labor might be required on any documented activity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="applying-rates">
<h2>Applying Rates<a class="headerlink" href="#applying-rates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A rate is used to apply charges in one of four ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Repeating</strong> rates may create separate charge entries according to a
calendar schedule. Repeating charges have fixed rates and quantities, so
the charge is always the same.
Calendar selections for repeating charges are for daily or daily within the
open billing month, weekdays on specific days, monthdays on specific
numbered days or on LAST or FIRST days, and year days (Julian) or year dates.</li>
<li><strong>Calculated</strong> rates apply storage and handling charges to products on
warehouse receipts and optionally shipments (for outbound handling), and to
calculate charges for recurring product balances.</li>
<li><strong>Mandatory</strong> rates may create charges on any documents, with calculation
quantities based on a broad range of options. For example, a document fee
could be applied by transaction for every shipment, while a line pick fee
might be applied for every line item after the third one.</li>
<li><strong>Optional</strong> rates are used to apply charges where either the occurrence, the
quantity, or the rate cannot be determined programmatically. As an example,
a charge for replacing a pallet shell and restacking goods would be optional,
as this activity cannot be anticipated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only optional rates can be used when entering charges on activities, as all
other rates are applied by billing calculation. Optional charges must be entered
on documents prior to performing calculated billing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setting-up-rates">
<h2>Setting Up Rates<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-rates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Rate Setup page is divided into three sections: Identifying Information,
Calculation Entries, and Calendar Information.</p>
<img alt="_images/account-rates.png" src="_images/account-rates.png" />
<div class="section" id="identifying-entries">
<h3>Identifying entries:<a class="headerlink" href="#identifying-entries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Identifying entries specify the rate grouping, the service to be performed,
the account association, and the activity and billing scope of the resulting
charges.</p>

<p>Rates are uniquely identified by the combination of a <strong>Rate Group</strong> and a
<strong>Service Code</strong>. The <strong>Rate Group</strong> entry can be either the word GLOBAL, an
account identifier, or a user-defined rate group.</p>
<p><strong>Service Code</strong> must be selected from the list of <a class="reference internal" href="04_services.html#services"><em>Warehousing Service Codes</em></a>.</p>
<p>Service codes determine which rates <strong>Apply</strong> as Calculated or Repeating, and
the <strong>Apply</strong> code is filled and protected accordingly. Other rates should be
set to Optional or Mandatory, depending on whether user entry is required to
determine a charge.</p>
<p>Optional rates are applied through user entry, while charges for mandatory
rates are created by billing calculations. Calculated rates are applied through
special routines. Finally, Repeating rates create charge records and accumulate
charges based on the repeating rate&#8217;s calendar schedule.</p>
<p>The <strong>Account</strong> entry is null for GLOBAL rates, filled with the account code
for rates in an account group, and otherwise either attached to an account or
blank (shared) for user-defined groups.</p>
<p>Each rate may restricted to apply to one or more transactional activities. Each
activity has a <strong>Per</strong> code to identify the quantity calculation for the rate,
and optional references to calculated objects for quantity and/or payer
to invoice for the charge.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>The rate <strong>Description</strong> entry is the actual invoice description for
calculated, mandatory, and repeating charges. This is the default charge
description for user-entered optional charges.</li>
<li>The <strong>Billing UOM</strong> (unit of measure) prints on charges and invoices to
describe the units of a charge quantity.</li>
<li>A <strong>Factor</strong> will divide the quantity in a charge to convert from inventory
quantity to billing quantity. For example, the factor <em>100.00</em> converts
inventory units <em>LB</em> into billing UOM <em>CW</em> (hundredweight).</li>
<li>A <strong>Surcharge</strong> percentage may apply to a rate to cover services taxes, fuel
surcharges, or other items. This is a percentage, not a decimal value.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rates portion of an entry is tiered by quantity, so that rates can increase
or decrease as quantity increases.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Where a <strong>Rate</strong> for a particular charge is variable, the Rate field may be
left blank and entered manually each time the charge is applied.</li>
<li>The <strong>Quantity</strong> defaults to 1.0. Quantity entries are required for tiered
rates.</li>
<li>A <strong>Minimum</strong> value for resulting charges defaults to <strong>Rate X quantity</strong>.
This minimum would be applied to every transaction line.</li>
<li>An <strong>Item Minimum</strong> can be applied to an entire transaction to result in
charges that are reasonable. For example, a handling charge of $.40 per case
is not reasonable when receiving a single case.</li>
