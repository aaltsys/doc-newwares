Recurring Calculation Audits

Recurring Reports
=============================

Recurring calculations produce two audit trails. The :ref:`bill-activity` 
detail inventory stock movement during the recurring period, resulting in a 
quantity balance to be billed. The :ref:`bill-storage` list charges billed for
the quantity balance.

The customer should receive both reports with the recurring storage invoice, 
one report for inventory management and the other for accounting.

.. note::
   Inventory may be tracked by unit, lot, or product, but the stock activity is 
   reported by lot or product using the billing units of the storage charges. 
   Then charges are summarized and reported by product only.

.. _bill-storage:

Recurring Charges Audits
-----------------------------

Recurring charges are always audited with a version of the *Charges Summary* 
report, as shown following. 

.. image:: _images/audit-recurring.png

.. note::
   Each row of this report lists charges for one product identifier/variety 
   combination. The **Activity** column contains the product identifier; the
   **Description** shows the product description, not the charge description. 

.. _bill-activity:

Stock Activity Audits
-----------------------------

Billing quantities for stock activity and balances are captured with the 
**Stock Activity Audit**. This report is divided into two sections: identifying 
information for each item on the left, and quantitative data on the right.

Columns for the report identifier section are:

+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| Column Name     | Description                        |
+=================+====================================+
| AUDIT           | (heading) Calculation Batch Number |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| RUN DATETIME    | (heading) Date Time batch started  |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+
+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| ACCOUNT         | Customer Account Code              |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+ 
| UOM             | Billing Quantity Unit of Measure   |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| PRODUCT         | Product Code Identifier            |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| VARIETY         | Variety Code, if used              |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| LOT             | When tracking lots, the Lot Number |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| RECEIVED        | Inventory date Posted + freedays   |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| UOM             | Per code UOM (units, packages, ...)|
+-----------------+------------------------------------+

**AUDIT** and **RUN** datetime apply to the entire report, and so these items 
appear in the report identifier section heading, as shown in the following 
sample Stock Activity report:

.. image:: _images/audit-activity.png

Activity Quantitative Data
-----------------------------

The following table lists quantitative data from the right side of the activity
report. Again, calendar range **BEGINNING** and **ENDING** apply to the entire 
report and so these items appear in the data section heading. All data columns 
are listed below.

+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| Column Name     | Description                        |
+=================+====================================+
| RANGE BEGINNING | (heading) Calendar Last Date + 1   |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| RANGE ENDING    | (heading) Calendar Next Date       |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+
+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| STARTING DATE   | Lot Anniversary Starting Date      |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+ 
| ON HAND         | Lot Balance on Starting Date       |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| RECEIVED        | Quantity Received during Period    |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| SHIPPED         | Quantity Shipped during Period     |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| ADJUSTED        | Quantity Adjusted during Period    |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| ENDING BALANCE  | Lot Balance at Period Ending Date  |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| ENDING DATE     | Lot Anniversary Ending Date        |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+


For a lot to be included in a particular recurring calculation batch, the lot 
anniversary **END DATE** must fall within the RANGE **STARTING** to **ENDING** 
bracket of the calculation batch. Lot anniversary **START DATE** and 
**END DATE** values are determined by the account's recurring calendar, and by 
the account's recurring configuration. 

.. note:: 
   Since the Stock Activity Audit is a product report, the UOM code *LB* is 
   taken from the product setup, which has units of measure for Units, 
   Packages, Inners, Weights and Dimensions. 

   Compare this to the Charges Audit, which is a billing report. The UOM code 
   used there is *CW*, and the activity quantities have been divided by 100 to 
   convert from *LB* to *CW*.

Period Transaction Reporting
-----------------------------

The **Received**, **Shipped**, and **Adjusted** columns of an Activity report 
are based on the inventory transactions posted in the period. A transaction 
detail report may be produced to audit the Activity Report, as shown following: 

.. image:: _images/audit-transactions.png

The preceding report images drill down from a recurring bill to the charges 
which constitute the invoice amount, to the audit of inventory lots and their 
activity, and to the individual transactions which determine lot balances.
