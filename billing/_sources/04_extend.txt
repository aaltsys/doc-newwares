How Rates Extend to Charges
#############################

A service may have a single rate, a break table of rates,  or tiered rates, 
where multiple rates in tiers vary with quantity. Charges are calculated from 
quantities and rates according to the following rules.

*  Quantity is required to be positive, the default value is 1.
*  Where the quantity is not 1, the rate is for the quantity stated. For 
   example, labor charged at the rate of $8.00 per quarter hour or fraction
   thereof would have a quantity of .25 and a rate of $8.00. Entered or 
   calculated Amounts will be adjusted in proportion to the quantity.
*  A rate entry is required unless the service is optional.
*  The default minimum is the quantity times the rate. Enter a higher amount as 
   desired.
*  The quantities or measures in tiered rates or rate break tables must be 
   listed in ascending order.
*  Tiered rates with minimums are calculated to eliminate rate irrationality.

Minimums and Deficits
=============================

Where a **Minimum** charge is part of a rate, and the calculated product of 
**Amount** and **Rate** is less than the Minimum, WARES will apply a **Deficit** 
to satisfy the minimum requirement. For single rates, a Deficit amount always 
increases the extension of a rate to meet a minimum. However, with tiered rates 
a deficit amount may result in a decreased extension, that is, it may be to the 
customer's benefit.

Basic Charge Calculations
=============================

The basic formula to calculate a charge from a rate is:

**Deficit** is the larger of::

   (a)  ( Minimum * Factor / Rate ) - Amount
   (b)  0

and **Charge** is::

   Charge = Rate * ( Amount + Deficit ) / Factor

Subtle differences in the way a rate is expressed may have significant effects 
on revenue. Following examples show a variety of charge calculations based on 
similar rate entries to illustrate this point.

Section 1: Single Line Rates
=============================

The simplest rates consist of a single line of information, as shown in example 
1.

.. image:: _images/rate-example1.png

Part (1a): Straight Rate
-----------------------------

Where a quantity is 1, the rate will provide a default minimum. In the example, 
a charge of $5.00 is applied to each qualifying activity (UOM = 1R represents 
a transaction). The Minimum is the Rate, and therefore Deficit is always zero.

Part (1b): Minimum Applies
-----------------------------

A **Minimum** greater than the **Rate** may apply, and deficient **Amounts** 
will trigger a **Deficit** to result in a charge equal to the minimum. In this 
example a $.32/case pick fee with a minimum equivalent to 5 cases is applied, 
while only 4 cases were picked.

Part (1c): Quantity Not One
-----------------------------

A decimal **Quantity** may be used for rates expressed in fractional amounts, 
or a **Quantity** may be greater than 1. Here MH labor is charged as $8.00 per 
quarter hour or fraction thereof, with a minimum of $16.00, or a half hour of 
labor. This changes the **Deficit** formula to the larger of::

   (a)  ( Minimum * Factor * Quantity / Rate ) - Amount
   (b)  0

and the extended **charge** formula becomes::

   Charge = Rate * ( Amount + Deficit ) / ( Quantity * Factor )

.. _rate-breaks:

Section 2: Rate Break Tables
=============================

Related single rates that differ by quantity level may be combined into a rate 
break table. An example of this would be picking charges for screws which are 
inventoried by each (EA) but are in bags of 12 (DZ) with 12 bags to a box (GS). 
Clearly picking is easier by the dozen or the gross, and so picking charges 
should reflect these economic order quantities (EOQ). 

There are two types of rate break tables: numeric breaks, and measure breaks. 
Screws inventoried and ordered by EA would require a numeric break table, while 
consumer items with variable packing but consistent units of measure, say
eaches (EA), inner packs (PK), and cases (CA), would require measure breaks.

A warehouse customer might have a group of products which are inventoried  
without inner measures, other products which break down into packs and eaches, 
and yet another group of products which are counted or measured into EOQ. Three 
separate rate groups could be defined for the account's picking fees, and the 
correct rate group could be applied optionally based on the product being 
picked. This might work, but it sounds like a billing nightmare. What if 
products from two groups are shipped on the same order? 

Fortunately WARES can address this problem. Three rate groups need to be 
defined, each of which would include the calculated rates for product storage 
and handling. The additional picking rates, also applied calculated, would be 
added to appropriate rate groups, and products would be assigned to rate groups 
according to their picking charge requirements. 

.. note::
   This example clarifies what "applied calculated" means: a calculated rate 
   depends on information external to the activity being rated. In this case, 
   the external information for applying the rate is the rate group assigned to 
   a product, and the measures used on the product. A special calculation
   routine is required to process this information. 

The following requirements apply to rate break tables:

#. A rate break table must belong to the calculated storage and handling rate 
   group for a product.
#. Break rates should be applied calculated, just as storage and handling are. 
#. All products in a rate group must use the same rate break table. If not, 
   create a separate rate group for non-conforming products.
#. For measure break rates, each product in the group must list the activity 
   units of measure from the rate table along with corresponding conversion 
   factors. 

.. tip::
   Where single-line rates are calculated by product group, the rates may be 
   defined in the same way as rate break tables. Said another way, a break 
   table must contain at least one rate line.

.. admonition:: Developer Comment

   An additional pair of data columns should be added to the PRODUCTS schema to 
   provide for UOM and factor conversions of measures which are not quantified 
   in inventory.

Charge calculation for a break table follows these steps:

#. Calculation begins with the largest line quantity which divides the activity 
   amount for a numeric rate table, or at the UOM line matching the activity 
   unit of measure for a measure table. 
#. The corresponding line of the table is applied as a single rate.
#. Where an activity amount is not evenly divided by a break line quantity, the 
   remainder amount is calculated as a separate charge line. 

.. image:: _images/rate-example2.png

Part (2a): Numeric Breaks
-----------------------------

Example (2a) shows order quantity breaks with corresponding billing UOMs. 
Ordering in multiples of 12 (DZ for dozen) or 144 (GS for gross) would apply
charges by the corresponding break line. Charge calculation proceeds as follows: 

#. Identify the largest break quantity less than or equal to the amount: 288 
   would go with line 3, and 24 would go with line 2. 
#. Divide the amount by the line quantity: dividing 288 by 144 results in a 
   billable amount of 2 GS, 24 divided by 12 gives a billable amount of 2 DZ. 
#. Treating a line as if it were a single rate, calculate any deficit and
   extend the charge. 2 GS extends to $16.00, and 2 DZ extends to $8.00.
#. Where division in Step 2 leaves a remainer, calculate the leftover amount as
   a separate charge billed at the preceding level. For example, 300 EA yields 
   two charge lines: 2 GS @ $8.00 = $16.00, and 1 DZ @ $4.00 = $4.00. Similarly 
   50 EA = 4 PK + 2 EA, generating billing lines for 4 PK @ $4.00 = $16.00 and 
   2 EA @ .50, with a minimum of $1.60, = $1.60.

Part (2b): Measure Breaks
-----------------------------
   
Example (2b) shows Each, Pack, and Case charges where inventory is counted in 
EA (each), but activity is performed in EOQ units of measure. Charges are 
calculated according to the UOM used. The break line of the corresponding UOM 
is treated as a single rate.

.. _rate-tiers:

Section 3: Rate Tiers 
=============================

Rate tiers offer several pricing options. A tiered rate may provide pricing 
with step changes (no deficits), with transition deficits benefiting the 
customer, or with transitions deficits penalizing the customer.

In this example, a container stripping fee is charged according to container 
weight. A charge is calculated for a container weighing 39,000 lb. and one 
weighing 40,000 lb. Rates are the same in each part of the example except for 
the minimums.

.. image:: _images/rate-example3.png

Part (3a): Irrational Rates
-----------------------------

Deficit quantities are not calculated when minimums are absent. in part (a), 
there are no minimums and the charge at 40,000 lb. is $12.40 less than the 
charge at 39,000 lb. This is considered a pricing irrationality.

Part (3b): Beneficial Deficit
-----------------------------

Irrationalities can be eliminated by applying line minimums. In part (b), the 
minimums on the second and third line equal the product of Quantity and Rate on
those lines. WARES will compare the charge with the minimum at the next higher 
break, and if that minimum is less, a deficit will be added to move to the next 
rate level.

Now when not the final rate tier, the **Deficit** calculation becomes, if::

   Minimum(n+1) < Rate(n) * Amount / ( Quantity(1) * Factor ) 

then::

   Deficit = Quantity(n+1) - Amount

else **Deficit** is the greater of::

   ( Minimum(n) * Factor * Quantity(1) / Rate(n) ) - Amount
   0

And the **Charge** calculation is as stated before at all tiers::

   Charge = Rate(n) * ( Amount + Deficit ) / ( Quantity(1) * Factor )

.. Admonition:: Example calculation

   Given the amount 39,000, we check the Minimum at the next level::

      128.00 < ( .3600 * 39,000 ) / ( 1.00 * 100.00 )

   And so the Deficit is::

      Deficit = 40,000 - 39,000 = 1,000 

   and the charge is always calculated as::

      Charge = .3200 * ( 39,000 + 1,000 ) / ( 1.00 * 100.00 ) = 128.00

The customer receives the benefit of a lower charge by being billed for a 
greater quantity based on the deficit.

Part (3c): Penalty Deficit
-----------------------------

To avoid a price reduction for amounts below a break level, minimums should
equal the break Quantity times the Rate of the previous level. In this example::

   Minimum(2) = Quantity(2) * Rate(1) / Factor = 20,000 * .400 / 100.0 = 80.0 
   Minimum(3) = Quantity(3) * Rate(2) / Factor = 40,000 * .360 / 100.0 = 144.0 

Now the charge at Amount = 39,000 lb. extends to $140.40 just as it did in part 
(a), but this is less than the next minimum of $144.00. 

At Amount = 40,000 lb. there is a Deficit = 5,000 so that the charge meets the 
line minimum, $144.00. There is no rate irrationality, but the customer 
receives no early benefit from the rate break.

Charges Auditing and Display
=============================

WARES produces invoices summarized by rate, and transaction details supporting 
the invoice are provided in audit reports. These reports are described in the 
documentation topic :ref:`bill-audits`.
