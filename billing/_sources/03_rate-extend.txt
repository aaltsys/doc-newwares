How Rates Extend to Charges
#############################

A service may have a single rate or tiered rates, where multiple rates in tiers 
vary with quantity. Charges are calculated from quantities and rates according 
to the following rules.

*  Quantity is required to be positive, the default value is 1.
*  Where the quantity is fractional, the rate is for the fraction stated. For 
   example, labor charged at the rate of $8.00 per quarter hour or fraction
   thereof would have a quantity of .25 and a rate of $8.00. Entered or 
   calculated Amounts will be adjusted to the fractional units of the quantity.
*  A rate entry is required unless the service is optional.
*  The default minimum is the quantity times the rate. Enter a higher amount as 
   desired.
*  Where rates are tiered, the guantities must be listed in ascending order.
*  Tiered rates with minimums are calculated to eliminate rate irrationality.

Minimums and Deficits
=============================

Where a **Minimum** charge is part of a rate, and the calculated product of 
**Amount** and **Rate** is less than the Minimum, WARES will apply a **Deficit** 
to satisfy the minimum requirement. For single rates, a Deficit amount always 
increases the extension of a rate to meet a minimum. However, with tiered rates 
a deficit amount may result in a decreased extension, that is, it may be to the 
customer's benefit.

Basic Charge Calculations
=============================

The basic formula to calculate a charge from a rate is:

**Deficit** is the larger of::

   (a)  ( Minimum * Factor ) / Rate - Amount
   (b)  0

and **Charge** is::

   Charge = Rate * ( Amount + Deficit ) / Factor

Subtle differences in the way a rate is expressed may have significant effects 
on revenue. Following examples show a variety of charge calculations based on 
similar rate entries to illustrate this point.

Example 1. Single Line Rates
=============================

The simplest rates consist of a single line of information, as shown in example 
1.

.. image:: _images/rate-example1.png

Part (1a): Straight Rate
-----------------------------

Where a quantity is 1, the rate will provide a default minimum. In the example, 
a charge of $5.00 is applied to each qualifying activity (UOM = 1R represents 
a transaction). The Minimum is the Rate, and therefore Deficit is always zero.

Part (1b): Minimum Applies
-----------------------------

A **Minimum** greater than the **Rate** may apply, and deficient **Amounts** 
will trigger a **Deficit** to result in a charge equal to the minimum. In this 
example a $.32/case pick fee with a minimum equivalent to 5 cases is applied, 
while only 4 cases were picked.

Part (1c): Decimal Quantity
-----------------------------

A decimal **Quantity** may be used for rates expressed in fractional amounts, 
or a **Quantity** may be greater than 1. Here MH labor is charged as $8.00 per 
quarter hour or fraction thereof, with a minimum of $16.00, or a half hour of 
labor. This changes the **Deficit** formula to the larger of::

   (a)  ( Minimum * Factor * Quantity ) / Rate - Amount
   (b)  0

and the extended **charge** formula becomes::

   Charge = Rate * ( Amount + Deficit ) / ( Quantity * Factor )

.. _rate-breaks:

Example 2: Quantity Breaks
=============================

Rates based on economic order quantity (EOQ) provide break pricing for specific 
quantities (cheaper by the dozen or gross) or compound units of measure (PK, 
CA). 

Break rates have a set of special requirements.

#. Break rates are associated with products. A break rate must be in the rate 
   group which includes calculated storage and handling rates for products.
#. All products may be charged the same storage and handling rates, but some 
   products have a break rate for picking, say, while others do not. Then 
   product-associated rates must be implemented in two groups: break-rated 
   products, and other products.
#. Break rates are **Applied** (C)alculated, just as storage and handling are.
#. Where break rates are associated with compound units of measure such as PK 
   and CA, products in the break group must list the same units of measure with 
   corresponding conversion quantities.
#. Where rates break according to quantity, order amounts are divided into even 
   break amounts and each amount produces a charge line calculated by single 
   rate methods discussed previously.

.. admonition:: Developer comment

   There are definition inadequacies in RATES, in that there is not a switch to 
   select explicitly between break rates and tiered rates. Then multiple 
   billing UOMs are not supported in the specification, but using multiple Bill 
   UOMs is a part of break rating.

.. image:: _images/rate-example2.png

Part (2a): Numerical Breaks
-----------------------------

Example (2a) shows order quantity breaks with corresponding billing UOMs. 
Ordering in multiples of 12 (DZ for dozen) or 144 (GS for gross) would apply
charges by the corresponding break line. Charge calculation proceeds as follows: 

#. Identify the largest break quantity less than or equal to the amount: 288 
   goes with line 3, and 24 goes with line 2. 
#. Divide the amount by the line quantity: dividing 288 by 144 results in a 
   billable amount of 2 GS, 24 divided by 12 gives a billable amount of 2 DZ. 
#. Treat a line as if it were a single rate, calculating any deficit and
   extending the charge. 2 GS extends to $16.00, and 2 DZ extends to $8.00.
#. Where division in Step 2 leaves a remainer, calculate the leftover amount as
   a separate charge billed at the preceding level. For example, 300 EA yields 
   two charge lines: 2 GS @ $8.00 = $16.00, and 1 DZ @ $4.00 = $4.00. Similarly 
   50 EA = 4 PK + 2 EA, generating billing lines for 4 PK @ $4.00 = $16.00 and 
   2 EA @ .50, with a minimum of $1.60, = $1.60.

Part (2b): Packing Breaks
-----------------------------
   
Example (2b) shows Each, Pack, and Case charges where inventory is counted in 
EA (each), but activity is performed in EOQ units of measure. Charges are 
calculated according to the UOM used. The break line of the corresponding UOM 
is treated as a single rate, as explained in Example 1.

.. _rate-tiers:

Example 3: Rate Tiers 
=============================

Rate tiers offer several pricing options. A tiered rate may provide pricing 
with step changes (no deficits), with transition deficits benefiting the 
customer, or with transitions deficits penalizing the customer.

In this example, a container stripping fee is charged according to container 
weight. A charge is calculated for a container weighing 39,000 lb. and one 
weighing 40,000 lb. Rates are the same in each part of the example except for 
the minimums.

.. image:: _images/rate-example3.png

Part (3a): Irrational Rates
-----------------------------

Deficit quantities are not calculated when minimums are absent. in part (a), 
there are no minimums and the charge at 40,000 lb. is $12.40 less than the 
charge at 39,000 lb. This is considered a pricing irrationality.

Part (3b): Beneficial Deficit
-----------------------------

Irrationalities can be eliminated by applying line minimums. In part (b), the 
minimums on the second and third line equal the product of Quantity and Rate on
those lines. WARES will compare the charge with the minimum at the next break, 
and if that minimum is less, a deficit will be added to move to the next rate 
level.

Now when not the final rate tier, the **Deficit** calculation becomes, if::

   Minimum(n+1) < Rate(n) * Amount / ( Quantity(1) * Factor ) 

then::

   Deficit = Quantity(n+1) - Amount
   n += 1

else **Deficit** is the greater of::

   Deficit = ( Minimum(n) * Factor * Quantity(1) ) / Rate(n) - Amount
   Deficit = 0

And the **Charge** calculation is as stated before at all tiers::

   Charge = Rate(n) * ( Amount + Deficit ) / ( Quantity(1) * Factor )

.. Admonition:: Example calculation

   Given the amount 39,000, we check the Minimum at the next level::

      128.00 < ( .3600 * 39,000 ) / ( 1.00 * 100.00 )

   And so the Deficit is::

      Deficit = 40,000 - 39,000 = 1,000 

   and the charge is always calculated as::

      Charge = .3200 * ( 39,000 + 1,000 ) / ( 1.00 * 100.00 ) = 128.00

The customer receives the benefit of a lower charge by being billed for a 
greater quantity based on the deficit.

Part (3c): Penalty Deficit
-----------------------------

To avoid a price reduction for amounts below a break level, minimums should
equal the break Quantity times the Rate of the previous level. In this example::

   Minimum(2) = Quantity(2) * Rate(1) / Factor = 20,000 * .400 / 100.0 = 80.0 
   Minimum(3) = Quantity(3) * Rate(2) / Factor = 40,000 * .360 / 100.0 = 144.0 

Now the charge at Amount = 39,000 lb. extends to $140.40 just as it did in part 
(a), but this is less than the next minimum of $144.00. 

At Amount = 40,000 lb. there is a Deficit = 5,000 so that the charge meets the 
line minimum, $144.00. There is no rate irrationality, but the customer 
receives no early benefit from the rate break.

Charges Auditing and Display
=============================

WARES produces invoices summarized by rate, and transaction details supporting 
the invoice are provided in audit reports. These reports are described in the 
documentation topic :ref:`bill-audits`.
