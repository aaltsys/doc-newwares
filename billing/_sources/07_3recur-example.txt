Recurring Issues and Examples
#############################

Recurring storage calculations are complicated. Many warehousing programs which 
attempt to calculate billing are yet unable to produce a correct bill which 
combines anniversary method with freedays. Fortunately, WARES exists to solve 
this problem, and many other issues with inventory tracking and billing.

Tracking 
=============================

Inventory tracking may be by unit, lot, or product. Recurring billing depends 
on the received date for goods, independent of the tracking method. 

Inventory Reconciliation
=============================

Damaged goods are included in recurring storage but not reported in available 
inventory.

Units of Measure
=============================

The units of measure for billing storage and handling can be different from the 
stock units for inventory movement. 

Recurring Methods
=============================

Recurring may be based on calendar periods, or on lot anniversaries. 

Free Days
=============================

Accounts may be offered free days affecting the starting date for applying 
storage charges or calculating anniversaries, as well as requiring the 
accumulation of both receiving and recurring charges during recurring 
calculation. 

Custom Periods
=============================

Accounts may require a warehouse to use their proprietary calendar period dates 
for reconciling inventory and calculating charges. 

Recurring may be calculated by month, or by alternative time periods such as 
daily, weekly, or bi-weekly.
