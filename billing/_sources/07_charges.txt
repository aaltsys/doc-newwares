Common Questions (FAQ)
=============================

*How can I set a minimum recurring invoice amount for an account?*

Answer:

  On the **Rates** page, enter a new rate record as follows:

  .. image:: _images/rate-faq1-id.png

  This rate will be evaluated as each invoice is generated for account **ABF**. 
  The quantity method **recurMinimum** will select all invoice lines with code 
  **1S** and this invoice number, and sum the extended column to determine an 
  amount. Method logic will return **Amount = 0** when recurring exceeds 250.00, 
  or when an invoice has no recurring charges.

  The **Factor**, **Rate**, and **Quantity** are all **1.00**, and the 
  **Minimum** is the minimum amount of recurring to charge, if any.

  Applying this rate will result in a deficit charge line on an invoice where 
  the recurring total is greater than zero, but less than $250.00.
