<p>While warehouse services are codified in legal and contractual terms, the
warehouse services are priced for a customer through a Rate Quote. In addition
to pricing services, WARES rates provide the mechanics of capturing services
and billing the customer for them. Entering rates requires considering both the
pricing aspect of rates and the application of rates to warehouse activity.</p>
<div class="section" id="rate-quote-information">
<h2>Rate Quote Information<a class="headerlink" href="#rate-quote-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A <strong>Rate Quote</strong> shows the customer services being offered and charges to be
billed for those services. Further, it guarantees the logistics company that
they will be fairly compensated for services rendered. Knowing the information
in a rate quote is crucial before entering rates. The WARES <strong>Rate Quote</strong>
displays a table of the following columns:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="18%" />
<col width="82%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">

<h2>Example of Quote Sections<a class="headerlink" href="#example-of-quote-sections" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An example partial rate quote is shown following to demonstrate how rates are
presented to the customer with WARES. There are four sections to the report,
determined by entries in the <strong>Account</strong> and <strong>Group</strong> columns.</p>
<img alt="_images/rates-quote.png" src="_images/rates-quote.png" />
<div class="section" id="sec-1-private-rates-by-account">
<h3>Sec. 1: Private Rates by Account<a class="headerlink" href="#sec-1-private-rates-by-account" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ACCOUNT = <strong>ABF</strong>, GROUP = <strong>ABF</strong>:</p>
<p>Rates grouped by the account identifier (ABF) appear first on the quote. When
entering rates in an account group, the account entry, <strong>ABF</strong> in this case,
will be automatically filled and protected. These rates are private to the
account, and a service code listed in this group will override a corresponding
rate in the general group <strong>GLOBAL</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sec-2-private-rates-by-group">
<h3>Sec. 2: Private Rates by Group<a class="headerlink" href="#sec-2-private-rates-by-group" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ACCOUNT = <strong>ABF</strong>, GROUP = user-defined:</p>
<p>Other groups which are restricted by the account identifier provide multiple
rate sets for an account, particularly for calculated storage and handling.
If an account identifier is entered on the first rate in a group, the account
is added and protected on all rates in the group.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sec-3-shared-rates-by-group">
<h3>Sec. 3: Shared Rates by Group<a class="headerlink" href="#sec-3-shared-rates-by-group" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ACCOUNT blank, GROUP = user-defined:</p>
<p>Where services and their rates are shared with multiple accounts, a shared
group is available to all accounts. If the account is left blank on the first
rate in a group, subsequent rates in the group will be shared as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sec-4-shared-global-rates">
<h3>Sec. 4: Shared GLOBAL Rates<a class="headerlink" href="#sec-4-shared-global-rates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ACCOUNT blank, GROUP = <strong>GLOBAL</strong>:</p>
<p>The <strong>GLOBAL</strong> group, which sets default service rates for all accounts, appears
last on the report. Account is blank and protected for all <strong>GLOBAL</strong> entries.
When a service code is used on a rate in an account group, any corresponding
<strong>GLOBAL</strong> rate is suppressed for that account.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="notes-on-quotes-example">
<h3>Notes on Quotes Example<a class="headerlink" href="#notes-on-quotes-example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>In the example report, the <strong>GLOBAL</strong> section shows Codes <strong>L1</strong> and
<strong>L2</strong>. The code <strong>L3</strong> appears in the private account group <strong>ABF</strong>, and
so this code is suppressed in group <strong>GLOBAL</strong> for customer <strong>ABF</strong>.</li>
<li>Codes <strong>1H</strong>, <strong>1R</strong>, and <strong>1S</strong> are used in both private groups for
<strong>ABF</strong> and the shared group <strong>FRZ-RK</strong>. Codes used in private groups do
not override the same codes in shared groups.</li>
<li>GLOBAL rate <strong>F2</strong> is a tiered rate. The amount charged per unit depends on
the quantity, as described in <a class="reference internal" href="#rate-tiers"><em>Example 5: Rate Tiers</em></a>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rates-entries">
<h2>Rates Entries<a class="headerlink" href="#rates-entries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In addition to the <strong>Rate Quote</strong> entries, WARES needs the activity information
which triggers a mandatory charge, the conversion of activity quantities into
billing units of measure, and the calendar for a repeating rate. The full
information for a rate can be broken down into three sections: the scope for
applying a rate, the rate calculation and display, and the repeating calendar.
This section details these rate parts.</p>
<div class="section" id="rate-identifying-scope">
<h3>Rate Identifying Scope<a class="headerlink" href="#rate-identifying-scope" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Rates are identified by the <strong>Rate Group</strong> and the <strong>Service Code</strong>. All Rates
belong to some group, and groups are either shared across all accounts or are
assigned to only one account. This links the rate group directly to the account.</p>
<p>While the <a class="reference internal" href="01_services.html#bill-services"><em>Service Codes</em></a> define the type of service offered, it also
determines the manner of applying the service. For example, service codes which
are applied <strong>Repeating</strong> and <strong>Calculated</strong> cannot be used in group <strong>GLOBAL</strong>,
as <strong>GLOBAL</strong> contains <strong>Optional</strong> rates only.</p>
<p>Similarly putting <strong>Mandatory</strong> or <strong>Repeating</strong> rates in a group which is not
associated to an account is possible, but not recommended. For example, if
every account receives the same charge for, say, Bills of Lading, then a shared
group without an account could include the <strong>Mandatory</strong> Bill of Lading service.
But: entering a rate with the same service code in an account group would result
in two charges, because account-associated rates override <strong>GLOBAL</strong> rates, but
not rates in other shared groups.</p>
<p>The following figure shows identifying entries for rates:</p>
<img alt="_images/rates-id.png" src="_images/rates-id.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="rate-activity-scope">
<h3>Rate Activity Scope<a class="headerlink" href="#rate-activity-scope" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Rates link to warehouse activities through a list of activity codes, where each
activity uses a <strong>Per</strong> code to convert activity quantity units into the rate&#8217;s
billing units. When a rate is associated with an activity list, the rate is
restricted to only that list of activities.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Where a standard per code cannot return a usable quantity, or if the payer of
a charge is not the account, then custom program methods may be required.

</div>
<div class="section" id="rules-regarding-rate-scope">
<h3>Rules Regarding Rate Scope<a class="headerlink" href="#rules-regarding-rate-scope" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A rate record identifies how to use a warehouse service code when applying
charges to an account. Rules which determine how to apply rates follow:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Either a rate is restricted to a single account, or it is shared with all
accounts, depending on whether the <strong>Account</strong> entry is filled.</li>
<li>All rates in a group must have the same account entry. When one rate in a
group is associated with an account, all rates in the same group must be
filled with the same account as well.</li>
<li>An optional rate may be restricted to one or more activities, or it may be
applicable to all activities.</li>
<li>All rates which are not optional must be associated with an activity so that
the rate can be calculated to produce charges.</li>
<li>Rates in an <strong>Account</strong> group override <strong>GLOBAL</strong> rates for the same service.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="additional-rates-properties">
<h3>Additional Rates Properties<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-rates-properties" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Any one service code can appear only once in a group.</li>
<li>Optional rates are charged through user entry, and all other rates are
charged by system routines.</li>
<li>Rates in the <strong>GLOBAL</strong> group are always <strong>Optional</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="charge-calculation-display">
<h2>Charge Calculation &amp; Display<a class="headerlink" href="#charge-calculation-display" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A service may have a single rate or tiered rates, where multiple rates in tiers
vary with quantity. Charges are calculated from quantities and rates according
to the following rules.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Quantity is required to be positive, the default value is 1.</li>
<li>Where the quantity is fractional, the rate is for the fraction stated. For
example, labor charged at the rate of $8.00 per quarter hour or fraction
thereof would have a quantity of .25 and a rate of $8.00. Entered or
calculated Amounts will be adjusted to the fractional units of the quantity.</li>
<li>A rate entry is required unless the service is optional.</li>
<li>The default minimum is the quantity times the rate. Enter a higher amount as
desired.</li>
<li>Where rates are tiered, the guantities must be listed in ascending order.</li>
<li>Tiered rates are calculated to eliminate rate irrationality.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="minimums-and-deficits">
<h3>Minimums and Deficits<a class="headerlink" href="#minimums-and-deficits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Where a <strong>Minimum</strong> charge is part of a rate, and the calculated product of
<strong>Amount</strong> and <strong>Rate</strong> is less than the Minimum, WARES will apply a <strong>Deficit</strong>
to satisfy the minimum requirement. For single rates, a Deficit amount always
increases the extension of a rate to meet a minimum. However, with tiered rates
a deficit amount may result in a decreased extension, that is, it may be to the
customer&#8217;s benefit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="basic-charge-calculations">
<h3>Basic Charge Calculations<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-charge-calculations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The basic formula to calculate a charge from a rate is:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Deficit</strong> is the larger of:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">(a)  ( Minimum * Factor ) / Rate  - Amount</div>
<div class="line">(b)  0</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">and <strong>Charge</strong> is:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">( Amount + Deficit ) * Rate / Factor</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Subtle differences in the way a rate is expressed may have significant effects
on revenue. The following figure shows a variety of charge calculations based
on similar rate entries to illustrate this point.</p>
<img alt="_images/rate-examples.png" src="_images/rate-examples.png" />
<div class="section" id="example-1">
<h4>Example 1:<a class="headerlink" href="#example-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Where a quantity is 1, the rate will provide a default minimum. In the example,
a charge of $5.00 is applied to each qualifying activity (UOM = 1R represents
a transaction). The Minimum is the Rate, and therefore Deficit is always zero.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example-2">
<h4>Example 2:<a class="headerlink" href="#example-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A <strong>Minimum</strong> greater than the <strong>Rate</strong> may apply, and deficient <strong>Amounts</strong>
will trigger a <strong>Deficit</strong> to result in a charge equal to the minimum. In this
example a $.32/case pick fee with a minimum equivalent to 5 cases is applied,
while only 4 cases were picked.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example-3">
<h4>Example 3:<a class="headerlink" href="#example-3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A decimal <strong>Quantity</strong> may be used for rates expressed in fractional amounts.
Here MH labor is charged as $8.00 per quarter hour or fraction thereof, with a
minimum of $16.00, or a half hour of labor. This changes the charge formula
<strong>Deficit</strong> calculation to:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Deficit</strong> is:</div>

<p>The previous table ends with a tiered rate, and an <strong>Amount</strong> close to the

nominal bracket:</p>
<div class="math">
\[Charge = ( 39000 \times .36 ) \over 100.00\]\[Charge = 140.40\]</div>
<p>The <strong>Minimum</strong> at the next tier, <strong>128.00</strong>, is less than <strong>140.40</strong>, and so
a deficit of <strong>1000.00</strong> would be applied. then the charge calculation becomes:</p>

<h3>Charge Display<a class="headerlink" href="#charge-display" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>CONSIDERATIONS WHEN ENTERING RATES:</p>
<p>Before any rates are entered, decide what services are being offered
and what the default, or retail, rates are for those services. When defining a
list of services, do not over-generalize. For example, do not lump all labor
services into a single heading, when they can be broken down into specific
activities such as RESTACKING, PACKAGING, RELOCATING, and so forth.</p>
<p>Global Rates: Once your business services are identified, enter a global
rate for each optional service using the highest rate charged.  These rate
records should be grouped under one rate name, for example, rate &#8220;GLOBAL&#8221;.
Leave the Account blank on these records, and set Apply to &#8220;Optional&#8221;.  These
Rates may be applied by hand on any account.</p>
<p>Override Rates: For negotiated rates on each account, use the account
identifier as the Tariff Key and enter the same code as the global service code
for that service.  Enter the Account identifier in the Account field as well.
This causes the negotiated rate to override the global rates for a service.</p>
<p>Mandatory Rates: Where a transaction should always generate a charge, enter a
rate for the service with Apply set to &#8220;Mandatory&#8221;.  Then a charge will be
added to each specified transaction on the rateed account.  Generally
Mandatory rates should be assigned to specific accounts.  Mandatory rates
are applied during Charges Calculation, or when changing a record&#8217;s status to
billed.</p>
<p>Repeating Rates: When a charge is not based on a transaction, but is applied
periodically instead, the rate for the charge should be made repeating.
Charge records for repeating rates are created during Charges Calculation,
when either &#8220;Only&#8221; or &#8220;Also&#8221;&#8221; is entered for &#8220;Apply Repeating Charges&#8221;.
Repeating rates are applied based on the rate schedule.</p>
<p>An example of a repeating rate would be a lease charge.  This charge might be
created on the first day of the month for the current month (current), on the
last day of the month for the future month (advance), or on the last day of the
month for the current month (arrears).  The schedule would be based on
&#8220;MONTHDAYS&#8221;, using the date value of &#8220;FIRST&#8221; for current billing and &#8220;LAST&#8221; for
either advance or arrears billing.</p>
<p>Calculated Rates: Frequently charges are calculated based on discounts,
prorating, and other considerations.  These rates are defined in the
rates window, but special input parameters and billing calculations may be
necessary to calculate the charges.  When charges are calculated by special
routines, the corresponding rates must be applied as &#8220;Calculated&#8221;.  An example
of calculated rates is the storage and handling charges in a warehousing
module.</p>
<p>Multiple Rates: Typically optional and mandatory rate codes are assigned by
account, while calculated rates are often assigned based on a grouping within
an account.  A particular calculated rate name may require multiple codes in
an account.</p>
