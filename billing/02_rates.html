<h1>Using Billing Rates<a class="headerlink" href="#using-billing-rates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Setting up rates starts with analyzing customer contracts. A customer agreement
should show a customer the services offered and charges billed for those
services, and it guarantees the logistics company that they will be fairly
compensated for services rendered.</p>
<div class="section" id="rate-quote-sections">
<h2>Rate Quote Sections<a class="headerlink" href="#rate-quote-sections" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An example partial rate quote is shown following to demonstrate how rates are
presented to the customer with WARES. There are four sections to the report,
determined by entries in the <strong>Account</strong> and <strong>Group</strong> columns.</p>
<img alt="_images/rate-quote.png" src="_images/rate-quote.png" />
<div class="section" id="private-rates-by-account">
<h3>Private Rates by Account<a class="headerlink" href="#private-rates-by-account" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ACCOUNT = <strong>ABF</strong>, GROUP = <strong>ABF</strong>:</p>
<p>Rates grouped by the account identifier (ABF) appear first on the quote. These
rates are private to the account, and each service code listed in this group
will override a corresponding rate in the general group <strong>GLOBAL</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="private-rates-by-group">
<h3>Private Rates by Group<a class="headerlink" href="#private-rates-by-group" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ACCOUNT = <strong>ABF</strong>, GROUP = user-defined:</p>
<p>Other groups which are restricted by the account identifier provide multiple
rate sets for an account, particularly for calculated storage and handling.
If an account identifier is entered on the first rate in a group, the account
is added and protected on all rates in the group.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="shared-rates-by-group">
<h3>Shared Rates by Group<a class="headerlink" href="#shared-rates-by-group" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ACCOUNT blank, GROUP = user-defined:</p>
<p>Where services and their rates are shared with multiple accounts, a shared
group is available to all accounts. If the account is left blank on the first
rate in a group, subsequent rates in the group will be shared as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rates-in-group-global">
<h3>Rates in group GLOBAL<a class="headerlink" href="#rates-in-group-global" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ACCOUNT blank, GROUP = <strong>GLOBAL</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>GLOBAL</strong> group, which sets default service rates for all accounts, appears
last on the report. Account is blank and protected for all <strong>GLOBAL</strong> entries.
When a service code is used on a rate in an account group, any corresponding
<strong>GLOBAL</strong> rate is suppressed for that account.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<ol class="last arabic simple">
<li>In the example report, the <strong>GLOBAL</strong> section shows Codes <strong>L1</strong> and
<strong>L2</strong>. The code <strong>L3</strong> appears in the private account group <strong>ABF</strong>, and
so this code is suppressed in group <strong>GLOBAL</strong> for customer <strong>ABF</strong>.</li>
<li>Codes <strong>1H</strong>, <strong>1R</strong>, and <strong>1S</strong> are used in both private groups for
<strong>ABF</strong> and the shared group <strong>FRZ-RK</strong>. Codes used in private groups do
not override the same codes in shared groups.</li>
<li>GLOBAL rate <strong>F2</strong> is a tiered rate. The actual amount charged depends on
the quantity, as described in <em class="xref std std-ref">rate-tiers</em>.</li>
<li>Rates in the <strong>GLOBAL</strong> group are always <strong>Optional</strong>.</li>

<p>These columns show a customer the rates which will be charged for services.
More information is required to complete a rate definition, such as the
calendar for a repeating rate, the activity which triggers a mandatory charge,
and the method of converting from inventory or activity quantities to the
chargeable quantities indicated by the billing units of measure.</p>

<div class="section" id="rates-entries">
<h2>Rates Entries<a class="headerlink" href="#rates-entries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>ENTERING RATES:</p>
<p>Rates may be modified or added at any time.  A rate should not be edited or
deleted when open transactions exist with the charge applied to them.  Please
refer to CONSIDERATIONS WHEN ENTERING RATES before entering rates for the
first time.</p>
<p>CONSIDERATIONS WHEN ENTERING RATES:</p>
<p>Before any rates are entered, one must decide what services are being offered
and what the default, or retail, rates are for those services.  When defining a
list of services, do not over-generalize.  For example, do not lump all labor
services into a single heading, when they can be broken down into specific
activities such as RESTACKING, PACKAGING, RELOCATING, and so forth.</p>
<p>Global Rates: Once your business services are identified, enter a global
rate for each optional service using the highest rate charged.  These rate
records should be grouped under one rate name, for example, rate &#8220;GLOBAL&#8221;.
Leave the Account blank on these records, and set Apply to &#8220;Optional&#8221;.  These
Rates may be applied by hand on any account.</p>
<p>Override Rates: For negotiated rates on each account, use the account
identifier as the Tariff Key and enter the same code as the global service code
for that service.  Enter the Account identifier in the Account field as well.
This causes the negotiated rate to override the global rates for a service.</p>
<p>Mandatory Rates: Where a transaction should always generate a charge, enter a
rate for the service with Apply set to &#8220;Mandatory&#8221;.  Then a charge will be
added to each specified transaction on the rateed account.  Generally
Mandatory rates should be assigned to specific accounts.  Mandatory rates
are applied during Charges Calculation, or when changing a record&#8217;s status to
billed.</p>
<p>Repeating Rates: When a charge is not based on a transaction, but is applied
periodically instead, the rate for the charge should be made repeating.
Charge records for repeating rates are created during Charges Calculation,
when either &#8220;Only&#8221; or &#8220;Also&#8221;&#8221; is entered for &#8220;Apply Repeating Charges&#8221;.
Repeating rates are applied based on the rate schedule.</p>
<p>An example of a repeating rate would be a lease charge.  This charge might be
created on the first day of the month for the current month (current), on the
last day of the month for the future month (advance), or on the last day of the
month for the current month (arrears).  The schedule would be based on
&#8220;MONTHDAYS&#8221;, using the date value of &#8220;FIRST&#8221; for current billing and &#8220;LAST&#8221; for
either advance or arrears billing.</p>
<p>Calculated Rates: Frequently charges are calculated based on discounts,
prorating, and other considerations.  These rates are defined in the
rates window, but special input parameters and billing calculations may be
necessary to calculate the charges.  When charges are calculated by special
routines, the corresponding rates must be applied as &#8220;Calculated&#8221;.  An example
of calculated rates is the storage and handling charges in a warehousing
module.</p>
<p>Multiple Rates: Typically optional and mandatory rate codes are assigned by
account, while calculated rates are often assigned based on a grouping within
an account.  A particular calculated rate name may require multiple codes in
an account.</p>
