WARES Master Index
=============================

#. :ref:`inventory:index`.

   The WARES transaction model for tracking inventory is configured through 
   product setup choices. Then documents create inventory transactions which 
   can be viewed in multiple ways, enabling a warehouse to manage labor 
   activities, provide location control, and support inventory viewing, 
   reporting, and customer communication.

#. :ref:`setup:index`.

   Selections on the WARES **Facility** menu will setup master information for 
   a warehouse company, its facilities, and the customer accounts and their 
   products which are served by the warehouse.

#. :ref:`documents:index`.

   Data entry forms in WARES are modeled to match warehouse activities: 
   receiving goods, shipping, rewarehousing, and so forth. At the same time, 
   WARES produces documents based on the contractual requirements of a 
   Warehouser's Standard Terms and Conditions, the Non-negotiable Warehouse 
   Receipt, and the Bill of Lading.

#. :ref:`exchange:index`.

   Data exchange with WARES partners may use several methods:

   *  Customers may view inventory and enter orders through the web portal.
   *  Transactional data encoded in JSON may be exchanged with WARES through 
      standard Internet protocols or services like DropBox.
   *  WARES supports X12 EDI formats for batch data transfers.

   WARES facilitating data exchange by using industry codes and terms throughout 
   the program and adhering to recognized information technology standards.

   solution based on individualized rates for receiving, accessorial, recurring, 
   and other charges.

#. :ref:`activity:index`.

   Warehouse floor activities such as receiving and putaway, picking and 
   shipping, rewarehousing, recouping, cycle counting, and other services can be
   performed using the Android-based mobile WARES app. This Google app store 
   download is not only free, it also frees the warehouse from paper forms, 
   building network wiring, and a host of technical problems which beset other 
   warehouse management systems.

#. :ref:`codes:index`.

   and a host of other purposes. Did we mention the codes? Industry standard 
   codes as well as options specific to WARES are documented in this section.

#. :ref:`resources:index`.

   WARES is a cloud-based service developed using open-source technology and
   standard information technology and services. Technical details such as
